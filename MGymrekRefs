  Abstract                 = {The identification of the causative genetic variants in quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing phenotypic traits is challenging, especially in crosses between outbred strains. We have previously identified several QTL influencing tameness and aggression in a cross between two lines of wild-derived, outbred rats (Rattus norvegicus) selected for their behavior towards humans. Here, we use targeted sequence capture and massively parallel sequencing of all genes in the strongest QTL in the founder animals of the cross. We identify many novel sequence variants, several of which are potentially functionally relevant. The QTL contains several regions where either the tame or the aggressive founders contain no sequence variation, and two regions where alternative haplotypes are fixed between the founders. A re-analysis of the QTL signal showed that the causative site is likely to be fixed among the tame founder animals, but that several causative alleles may segregate among the aggressive founder animals. Using a formal test for the detection of positive selection, we find 10 putative positively selected regions, some of which are close to genes known to influence behavior. Together, these results show that the QTL is probably not caused by a single selected site, but may instead represent the joint effects of several sites that were targets of polygenic selection.},

We have assessed 360 HD individuals from 259 unrelated families and found a highly significant correlation (r = 0.70, p = 10(-7)) between the age of onset and the repeat length, which accounts for approximately 50% of the variation in the age of onset. Significant associations were also found between repeat length and age of death and onset of other clinical features. Sib pair and parent-child analysis revealed that the CAG repeat demonstrates only mild instability. Affected HD siblings had significant correlations for trinucleotide expansion (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) which was not apparent for affected parent-child pairs.},

In this paper we investigate its performance on the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Cell Broadband Engine, a heterogeneous multicore chip architected for intensive gaming applications and high performance computing. The Cell processor consists of a traditional microprocessor (called the PPE) that controls eight SIMD co-processing units called synergistic processor elements (SPEs). We exploit the architectural features of the Cell processor to design an efficient parallel implementation of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). While there have been several attempts to develop a fast implementation of FFT on the Cell, none have been able to achieve high performance for input series with several thousand complex points. We use an iterative out-of-place approach to design our parallel implementation of FFT with 1K to 16K complex input samples and attain a single precision performance of 18.6 GFLOP/s on the Cell. Our implementation beats FFTW on Cell by several GFLOP/s for these input sizes and outperforms Intel Duo Core (Woodcrest) for inputs of greater than 2K samples. To our knowledge we have the fastest FFT for this range of complex inputs.},

  Abstract                 = {Discrete transforms are of primary importance and fundamental kernels in many computationally intensive scientific applications. In this paper, we investigate the performance of two such algorithms; Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), on the Sony-Toshiba-IBM Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/B.E.), a heterogeneous multicore chip architected for intensive gaming applications and high performance computing. We design an efficient parallel implementation of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to fully exploit the architectural features of the Cell/B.E. Our FFT algorithm uses an iterative out-of-place approach and for 1K to 16K complex input samples outperforms all other parallel implementations of FFT on the Cell/B.E. including FFTW. Our FFT implementation obtains a single-precision performance of 18.6 GFLOP/s on the Cell/B.E., outperforming Intel Duo Core (Woodcrest) for inputs of greater than 2K samples. We also optimize Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in the context of JPEG2000 for the Cell/B.E. DWT has an abundant parallelism, however, due to the low temporal locality of the algorithm, memory bandwidth becomes a significant bottleneck in achieving high performance. We introduce a novel data decomposition scheme to achieve highly efficient DMA data transfer and vectorization with low programming complexity. Also, we merge the multiple steps in the algorithm to reduce the bandwidth requirement. This leads to a significant enhancement in the scalability of the implementation. Our optimized implementation of DWT demonstrates 34 and 56 times speedup using one Cell/B.E. chip to the baseline code for the lossless and lossy transforms, respectively. We also provide the performance comparison with the AMD Barcelona (Quad-core Opteron) processor, and the Cell/B.E. excels the AMD Barcelona processor. This highlights the advantage of the Cell/B.E. over general purpose multicore processors in processing regular and bandwidth intensive scientific applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {STR loci are becoming increasingly important in forensic casework. In order to be used fairly and efficiently, the population genetics of these loci must be investigated and the implications for forensic inference assessed. A key population genetics parameter is the "coancestry coefficient", or FST, which is the correlation between two genes sampled from distinct individuals within a subpopulation. We present analyses of STR data, at geographic scales which range from national to regional, from the UK and other European sources. We implement a likelihood-based method of estimating FST, which has important advantages over alternative methods: it allows a range of plausible values to be assessed, rather than presenting a single point estimate, and it allows a subpopulation to be compared with a larger population from which a database has been drawn, which is the relevant comparison in forensic work. Our results suggest that values of FST appropriate to forensic applications in Europe are too large to be ignored. With appropriate allowance, however, it is possible to make use of STR evidence in a way which is efficient yet avoids overstatement of evidential strength.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonrecombining Y-chromosomal microsatellites (Y-STRs) are widely used to infer population histories, discover genealogical relationships, and identify males for criminal justice purposes. Although a key requirement for their application is reliable mutability knowledge, empirical data are only available for a small number of Y-STRs thus far. To rectify this, we analyzed a large number of 186 Y-STR markers in nearly 2000 DNA-confirmed father-son pairs, covering an overall number of 352,999 meiotic transfers. Following confirmation by DNA sequence analysis, the retrieved mutation data were modeled via a Bayesian approach, resulting in mutation rates from 3.78 x 10(-4) (95% credible interval [CI], 1.38 x 10(-5) - 2.02 x 10(-3)) to 7.44 x 10(-2) (95% CI, 6.51 x 10(-2) - 9.09 x 10(-2)) per marker per generation. With the 924 mutations at 120 Y-STR markers, a nonsignificant excess of repeat losses versus gains (1.16:1), as well as a strong and significant excess of single-repeat versus multirepeat changes (25.23:1), was observed. Although the total repeat number influenced Y-STR locus mutability most strongly, repeat complexity, the length in base pairs of the repeated motif, and the father's age also contributed to Y-STR mutability. To exemplify how to practically utilize this knowledge, we analyzed the 13 most mutable Y-STRs in an independent sample set and empirically proved their suitability for distinguishing close and distantly related males. This finding is expected to revolutionize Y-chromosomal applications in forensic biology, from previous male lineage differentiation toward future male individual identification.},

  Abstract                 = {The panels of 9-17 Y-chromosomal short tandem repeats (Y-STRs) currently used in forensic genetics have adequate resolution of different paternal lineages in many human populations, but have lower abilities to separate paternal lineages in populations expressing low Y-chromosome diversity. Moreover, current Y-STR sets usually fail to differentiate between related males who belong to the same paternal lineage and, as a consequence, conclusions cannot be drawn on the individual level as is desirable for forensic interpretations. Recently, we identified a new panel of rapidly mutating (RM) Y-STRs, composed of 13 markers with mutation rates above 1 x 10(-2), whereas most Y-STRs, including all currently used in forensics, have mutation rates in the order of 1 x 10(-3) or lower. In the present study, we demonstrate in 604 unrelated males sampled from 51 worldwide populations (HGDP-CEPH) that the RM Y-STRs provide substantially higher haplotype diversity and haplotype discrimination capacity (with only 3 haplotypes shared between 8 of the 604 worldwide males), than obtained with the largest set of 17 currently used Y-STRs (Yfiler) in the same samples (33 haplotypes shared between 85 males). Hence, RM Y-STRs yield high-resolution paternal lineage differentiation and provide a considerable improvement compared to Yfiler. We also find in this worldwide dataset substantially less genetic population substructure within and between geographic regions with RM Y-STRs than with Yfiler Y-STRs. Furthermore, with the present study we provide enhanced data evidence that the RM Y-STR panel is extremely successful in differentiating between closely and distantly related males. Among 305 male relatives, paternally connected by 1-20 meiotic transfers in 127 independent pedigrees, we show that 66% were separated by mutation events with the RM Y-STR panel whereas only 15% were with Yfiler; hence, RM Y-STRs provide a statistically significant 4.4-fold increase of average male relative differentiation relative to Yfiler. The RM Y-STR panel is powerful enough to separate closely related males; nearly 50% of the father and sons, and 60% of brothers could be distinguished with RM Y-STRs, whereas only 7.7% and 8%, respectively, with Yfiler. Thus, by introducing RM Y-STRs to the forensic genetic community we provide important solutions to several of the current limitations of Y chromosome analysis in forensic genetics.},

Tandem repeats have been shown to cause human disease, may play a variety of regulatory and evolutionary roles and are important laboratory and analytic tools. Extensive knowledge about pattern size, copy number, mutational history, etc. for tandem repeats has been limited by the inability to easily detect them in genomic sequence data. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for finding tandem repeats which works without the need to specify either the pattern or pattern size. We model tandem repeats by percent identity and frequency of indels between adjacent pattern copies and use statistically based recognition criteria. We demonstrate the algorithm's speed and its ability to detect tandem repeats that have undergone extensive mutational change by analyzing four sequences: the human frataxin gene, the human beta T cellreceptor locus sequence and two yeast chromosomes. These sequences range in size from 3 kb up to 700 kb. A World Wide Web server interface atc3.biomath.mssm.edu/trf.html has been established for automated use of the program.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

We report here a meta-analysis of short RNA data from Drosophila melanogaster, aggregating published libraries with 76 data sets that we generated for the modENCODE project. In total, we began with more than 1 billion raw reads from 187 libraries comprising diverse developmental stages, specific tissue- and cell-types, mutant conditions, and/or Argonaute immunoprecipitations. We elucidated several features of known miRNA loci, including multiple phased byproducts of cropping and dicing, abundant alternative 5' termini of certain miRNAs, frequent 3' untemplated additions, and potential editing events. We also identified 49 novel genomic locations of miRNA production, and 61 additional candidate loci with limited evidence for miRNA biogenesis. Although these loci broaden the Drosophila miRNA catalog, this work supports the notion that a restricted set of cellular transcripts is competent to be specifically processed by the Drosha/Dicer-1 pathway. Unexpectedly, we detected miRNA production from coding and untranslated regions of mRNAs and found the phenomenon of miRNA production from the antisense strand of known loci to be common. Altogether, this study lays a comprehensive foundation for the study of miRNA diversity and evolution in a complex animal model.},

In the initial phase of ClinSeq, we are enrolling roughly 1000 participants; the evaluation of each includes obtaining a detailed family and medical history, as well as a clinical evaluation. The participants are being consented broadly for research on many traits and for whole-genome sequencing. Initially, Sanger-based sequencing of 300-400 genes thought to be relevant to atherosclerosis is being performed, with the resulting data analyzed for rare, high-penetrance variants associated with specific clinical traits. The participants are also being consented to allow the contact of family members for additional studies of sequence variants to explore their potential association with specific phenotypes. Here, we present the general considerations in designing ClinSeq, preliminary results based on the generation of an initial 826 Mb of sequence data, the findings for several genes that serve as positive controls for the project, and our views about the potential implications of ClinSeq. The early experiences with ClinSeq illustrate how large-scale medical sequencing can be a practical, productive, and critical component of research in genomic medicine.},

This heterogeneity in treatment response could result from genetic modifiers that regulate the degree to which tumour cells are dependent on mutant EGFR. Through a pooled RNA interference screen, we show that knockdown of FAS and several components of the NF-kappaB pathway specifically enhanced cell death induced by the EGFR TKI erlotinib in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. Activation of NF-kappaB through overexpression of c-FLIP or IKK (also known as CFLAR and IKBKB, respectively), or silencing of IkappaB (also known as NFKBIA), rescued EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells from EGFR TKI treatment. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of NF-kappaB enhanced erlotinib-induced apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer models. Increased expression of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB predicted for improved response and survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients treated with EGFR TKI. These data identify NF-kappaB as a potential companion drug target, together with EGFR, in EGFR-mutant lung cancers and provide insight into the mechanisms by which tumour cells escape from oncogene dependence.},

We have developed an assay to accurately determine CAG repeats that combines a novel oligonucleotide design and the resolution of capillary electrophoresis. A mismatch in the second nucleotide from the 3' end enhanced specificity by avoiding mispriming and diminishing shadow bands and artifactual PCR products. The coupling of capillary electrophoresis analysis with the assay added the advantages of accuracy, high resolution, semi-automation, rapid analysis and low sample consumption. Analysis of 200 chromosomes in the Spanish population sample studied (control group) gave a peak frequency for 16 CAG repeats and of 7 triplets for CCG repeats. Diagnosis of HD was confirmed in 22 of 34 individuals with a range of CAG repeats from 39 to 52. Predictive testing was also carried out for 19 relatives of the HD families diagnosed at our laboratory. The method proposed in this article provides an accurate sizing of DNA repeats that can be applied to the analysis of DNA size-related disorders.},

Using a tagging mechanism and formula rewriting, we extend SPIRAL to automatically generate parallelized formulas. Using the same mechanism, we enable the generation of resealing DFT algorithms, which redistribute the data in intermediate steps to fewer processors to reduce communication overhead. It is a novel feature of these methods that the redistribution steps are merged with the communication steps of the algorithm to avoid additional communication overhead. Among the possible alternative algorithms, SPIRAL's search mechanism now determines the fastest for a given platform, effectively generating adapted code without human intervention. Experiments with DFT MPI programs generated by SPIRAL show performance gains of up to 30% due to resealing. Further, our generated programs compare favorably with FFTW-MPI 2.1.5.},

The algorithms also allow for aggressive vectorization (even for non-power-of-2 orders) and easier optimization of trivial twiddle factor multiplies. We benchmark and implementations with comparable Cooley-Tukey implementations on commodity hardware. In a comparison designed to isolate the effect of twiddle factor access optimization, these benchmarks show typical speedups ranging from 10% to 65%, depending on transform order, precision, and vectorization. A more heavily optimized implementation of yields substantial performance improvements over the widely used code FFTW for many transform orders. The twiddle factor access optimization technique can be generalized to other common FFT algorithms, including real-data FFTs, split-radix FFTs, and multidimensional FFTs.},

  Abstract                 = {Algorithms are developed for calculating dealiased linear convolution sums without the expense of conventional zero-padding or phase-shift techniques. For one-dimensional in-place convolutions, the memory requirements are identical with the zero-padding technique, with the important distinction that the additional work memory need not be contiguous with the input data. This decoupling of data and work arrays dramatically reduces the memory and computation time required to evaluate higher-dimensional in-place convolutions. The technique also allows one to dealias the higher-order convolutions that arise from Fourier transforming cubic and higher powers. Implicitly dealiased convolutions can be built on top of state-of-the-art fast Fourier transform libraries: vectorized multidimensional implementations for the complex and centered Hermitian (pseudospectral) cases have been implemented in the open-source software FFTW++.},

  Abstract                 = {Autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset disease with a world-wide distribution. It usually presents in the sixth decade with progressive swallowing difficulties (dysphagia), eyelid drooping (ptosis) and proximal limb weakness. Unique nuclear filament inclusions in skeletal muscle fibres are its pathological hallmark. We isolated the poly(A) binding protein 2 gene (PABP2) from a 217-kb candidate interval on chromosome 14q11 (B.B. et al., manuscript submitted). A (GCG)6 repeat encoding a polyalanine tract located at the N terminus of the protein was expanded to (GCG)8-13 in the 144 OPMD families screened. More severe phenotypes were observed in compound heterozygotes for the (GCG)9 mutation and a (GCG)7 allele that is found in 2% of the population, whereas homozygosity for the (GCG)7 allele leads to autosomal recessive OPMD. Thus the (GCG)7 allele is an example of a polymorphism which can act either as a modifier of a dominant phenotype or as a recessive mutation. Pathological expansions of the polyalanine tract may cause mutated PABP2 oligomers to accumulate as filament inclusions in nuclei.},

As a consequence, it is becoming increasingly prominent in numerous earth observing applications [1]. However, there are many factors to be considered affecting how such a processing cluster can be built and used efficiently. Foremost, a fundamental understanding of the interplay between computation and I/O activities of the application is required [2]. It is also important to be familiar with available state-of-the-art software components which can be used for the well-understood portions of application processing (e.g. FFTW [3] for convolutions). And when the application requires novel algorithms, an understanding of modem computer architectural concepts such as superscalar pipelining and cache management can make a significant difference in processing efficiency [4]. In addition to technical requirements, other factors such as the inhomogeneity of developer skills and resources, and deployment and future maintenance/upgrade expectations should be addressed. Here, we address each of these factors and discuss how they were analyzed to model a clustering solution for the calibration and processing of large volume imaging spectroscopy data for the European Space Agency's Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX).},

The mutation rate was between 0 and 7 x 10(-3) per locus per gamete per generation. No mutations were observed in three of the nine loci. Mutation events in the male germ line were five to six times more frequent than in the female germ line. A positive exponential correlation between the geometric mean of the number of uninterrupted repeats and the mutation rate was observed. Our data demonstrate that mutation rates of different loci can differ by several orders of magnitude and that different alleles at one locus exhibit different mutation rates.},

As part of the map building process, 0.08% of the genotypes that resulted in tight double recombinants and that largely, if not entirely, represent genotyping errors, mutations, or gene-conversion events were removed. The total female, male, and sex-averaged lengths of the final maps were 44, 27, and 35 morgans, respectively. Numerous (267) sets of STRPs were identified that represented the exact same loci yet were developed independently and had different primer pairs. The distributions of the total number of recombination events per gamete, among the eight mothers of the CEPH families, were significantly different, and this variation was not due to maternal age. The female:male ratio of genetic distance varied across individual chromosomes in a remarkably consistent fashion, with peaks at the centromeres of all metacentric chromosomes. The new linkage maps plus much additional information, including a query system for use in the construction of reliably ordered maps for selected subsets of markers, are available from the Marshfield Website.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Reports on air pollution and asthma exacerbations have been inconsistent, although effects of airborne allergen can be spectacular. With no generalized test for allergen in air, it is not known how far allergen is responsible for nonepidemic exacerbations of the disease.
Methods: Two hundred and ninety-seven patients using bronchodilators aged 18-64 years attending a London practice provided serum samples and were asked to report any acute respiratory events over the coming months. Small particles with a mean aerodynamic diameter < 10 mu m (PM10) were collected using a high volume sampler on the roof of the practice. The ability of airborne particles to bind IgE from the patients was compared for particles sampled on the weekend before their reported exacerbation with particles sampled on the weekend 2 weeks before or after.
Results: Exacerbations were associated with a 25% increase in IgE binding to particles collected on the previous weekend compared with the control weekends (95% confidence interval: 10-43%; P = 0.00089). This increase was not higher in patients with positive skin tests or in those sensitized to grass or tree pollens.
Conclusions: Airborne allergen is an important cause of exacerbations even in those with 'intrinsic' asthma. It is important to identify the allergens responsible, as some of these may be controllable. Interpretation of associations of asthma exacerbations with other air pollutants is difficult in the light of these findings.},

The physical location of each STR locus in the human genome is delineated and allele ranges and variants observed in human populations are summarized as are mutation rates observed from parentage testing. Internet resources for additional information on core STR loci are reviewed. Additional topics are also discussed, including potential linkage of STR loci to genetic disease-causing genes, probabilistic predictions of sample ethnicity, and desirable characteristics for additional STR loci that may be added in the future to the current core loci.

  Abstract                 = {Recently Kruglyak, Durrett, Schug, and Aquadro showed that microsatellite equilibrium distributions can result from a balance between polymerase slippage and point mutations. Here, we introduce an elaboration of their model that keeps track of all parts of a perfect repeat and a simplification that ignores point mutations. We develop a detailed mathematical theory for these models that exhibits properties of microsatellite distributions, such as positive skewness of allele lengths, that are consistent with data but are inconsistent with the predictions of the stepwise mutation model. We use our theoretical results to analyze the successes and failures of the genetic distances (delta(mu))(2) and D(SW) when used to date four divergences: African vs. non-African human populations, humans vs. chimpanzees, Drosophila melanogaster vs. D. simulans, and sheep vs. cattle. The influence of point mutations explains some of the problems with the last two examples, as does the fact that these genetic distances have large stochastic variance. However, we find that these two features are not enough to explain the problems of dating the human-chimpanzee split. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that long microsatellites have a mutational bias that favors contractions over expansions.},

  Abstract                 = {Repetitive DNA sequences, interspersed throughout the human genome, are capable of forming a wide variety of unusual DNA structures with simple and complex loopfolding patterns. The hairpin formed by the fragile X repeat, (CCG)n, and the bipartite triplex formed by the Friedreich's ataxia repeat, (GAA)n/(TTC)n, show simple loopfolding. On the other hand, the doubly folded hairpin formed by the human centromeric repeat, (AATGG)n, the hairpin G-quartet formed by (TTAGGG)n at the 3' telomere overhang, and the hairpin G-quartet, and hairpin C+.C paired i-motif formed by the insulin minisatellite, [formula: see text] show multiple and complex loopfolding. We have performed high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and in vitro replication to show that unique base-pairing and loopfolding render stability to these unusual structures under physiological conditions. The formation of such stable structures offers a mechanism of unwinding which is advantageous during transcription. For example, the formation of the hairpin G-quartet, and hairpin C+.C paired i-motif upstream of the insulin gene may facilitate transcription. These unusual DNA structures also provide unique 'protein recognition motifs' quite different from a Watson-Crick double helix. For example, the hairpin G-quartet formed by (TTAGGG)n at the 3' telomere overhang is specifically recognized and stabilized by the human repair protein, Ku70/Ku80 hetero-dimer, which may be important in the stability of the telomere. However, the formation of the same unusual DNA structures during replication is likely to cause instability in the lengths of the DNA repeats. If the altered (generally expanded) length enhances the probability of the unusual structure during the next cycle of replication, it further increases the instability of the repeat causing a 'dynamic mutation'. In fact, NMR and in vitro replication studies show that the longer the repeat length the higher is the probability of hairpin formation by the fragile X repeat, (CCG)n. In addition, the hairpin of the fragile X repeat, upstream of the FMR-1 gene, is more susceptible to CpG methylation than its duplex thereby leading to methyl-directed suppression of transcription. Thus, the selective advantage of the unusual structures formed by the DNA repeats in the regulation of gene expression may be offset by the genomic instability caused by the same structures during replication. The repeat number is a critical parameter that helps maintain a balance between the advantage gained from an unusual structure during gene expression and the disadvantage posed by the same structure during replication.},

To identify missing sequence and genetic variation, here we sequence and analyse a haploid human genome (CHM1) using single-molecule, real-time DNA sequencing. We close or extend 55% of the remaining interstitial gaps in the human GRCh37 reference genome--78% of which carried long runs of degenerate short tandem repeats, often several kilobases in length, embedded within (G+C)-rich genomic regions. We resolve the complete sequence of 26,079 euchromatic structural variants at the base-pair level, including inversions, complex insertions and long tracts of tandem repeats. Most have not been previously reported, with the greatest increases in sensitivity occurring for events less than 5 kilobases in size. Compared to the human reference, we find a significant insertional bias (3:1) in regions corresponding to complex insertions and long short tandem repeats. Our results suggest a greater complexity of the human genome in the form of variation of longer and more complex repetitive DNA that can now be largely resolved with the application of this longer-read sequencing technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Using the generalized stepwise mutation model, we propose a method of estimating the relative mutation rates of microsatellite loci, grouped by the repeat motif. Applying ANOVA to the distributions of the allele sizes at microsatellite loci from a set of populations, grouped by repeat motif types, we estimated the effect of population size differences and mutation rate differences among loci. This provides an estimate of motif-type-specific mutation rates up to a multiplicative constant. Applications to four different sets of di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide loci from a number of human populations reveal that, on average, the non-disease-causing microsatellite loci have mutation rates inversely related to their motif sizes. The dinucleotides appear to have mutation rates 1.5-2 times higher than the tetranucleotides, and the non-disease-causing trinucleotides have mutation rates intermediate between the di- and tetranucleotides. In contrast, the disease-causing trinucleotides have mutation rates 3.9-6.9 times larger than the tetranucleotides. Comparison of these estimates with the direct observations of mutation rates at microsatellites indicates that the earlier suggestion of higher mutation rates of tetranucleotides in comparison with the dinucleotides may stem from a nonrandom sampling of tetranucleotide loci in direct mutation assays.},

  Abstract                 = {As the last-level on-chip caches in chip-multiprocessors increase in size, the physical locality of on-chip data becomes important for delivering high performance. The non-uniform access latency seen by a core to different independent banks of a large cache spread over the chip necessitates active mechanisms for improving data locality. The central proposal of this paper is a fully hardwired coarse-grain data migration mechanism that dynamically monitors the access patterns of the cores at the granularity of a page to reduce the book-keeping overhead and decides when and where to migrate an entire page of data to amortize the performance overhead. The page-grain migration mechanism is compared against two variants of previously proposed cache block-grain dynamic migration mechanisms and two OS-assisted static locality management mechanisms. Our detailed execution-driven simulation of an eight-core chip-multiprocessor with a shared 16 MB L2 cache employing a bidirectional ring to connect the cores and the L2 cache banks shows that hardwired dynamic page migration, while using only 4.8% of extra storage out of the total L2 cache and book-keeping budget, delivers the best performance and energy-efficiency across a set of shared memory parallel applications selected from the SPLASH-2, SPEC OMP, DARPA DIS, and FFTW suites and multiprogrammed workloads prepared out of the SPEC 2000 and BioBench suites. It reduces execution time by 18.7% and 12.6% on average (geometric. c mean) respectively for the shared memory applications and the multiprogrammed workloads compared to a baseline architecture that distributes the pages round-robin across the L2 cache banks.},

Previous clinical trials of ARF have been hampered by the heterogeneous population affected, difficulty defining ARF, delays in identification of ARF, and significant comorbid conditions, among other factors. METHODS: The Program to Improve Care in Acute Renal Disease (PICARD) phase I was a multicenter cohort study aimed to identify clinical characteristics and practice patterns associated with adverse and favorable outcomes in patients with ARF in intensive care units. Although PICARD used no interventions, signed informed consent was required of all study subjects or their proxies. RESULTS: Signed informed consent was obtained in 645 of 1,243 ARF episodes (52%). The fraction of patients not enrolled and reasons for non-enrollment varied widely across the 5 PICARD centers. Refusal by potential study subjects was infrequent, although the absence of family or proxy (15%) and refusal by family or proxy (18%) accounted for large fractions of non-enrolled subjects. Death (23%) and discharge (11%) before study personnel could evaluate patients were additional important reasons for non-enrollment. CONCLUSION: Understanding reasons for non-enrollment may help rationalize mortality and other outcome differences seen in clinical trials and cohort studies that require informed consent compared with historic reports of "all comers" with ARF.},

We validated the cis-acting regulators by demonstrating differential allelic expression with sequencing of transcriptomes (RNA-Seq) and the trans-regulators by gene knockdown, metabolic assays, and chromosome conformation capture analysis. The majority of the regulators act in trans to the target (regulated) genes. Most of these trans-regulators were not known to play a role in gene expression regulation. The identification of these regulators enabled the characterization of polymorphic regulation of human gene expression at a resolution that was unattainable in the past.},

Our algorithm uses high-order imaginary time propagators to project out the eigenfunctions. A recently developed multi-product, operator splitting method permits, in principle. convergence to any even order of the time step. We review briefly the theory behind the method and discuss strategies for assessing convergence and accuracy. A forward time step, single product fourth-order factorization of the imaginary time evolution operator can also be used.
Our code requires one user defined function which specifies the local external potential. We describe the definition of this function as well as input and output functionalities and convergence criteria. Compared to our previously published code [Computer Physics Communications 178 (2008) 835], the new algorithms can converge at a rate that is only limited by machine precision.

  Abstract                 = {Somatic reprogramming induced by defined transcription factors is a low-efficiency process that is enhanced by p53 deficiency. So far, p21 is the only p53 target shown to contribute to p53 repression of iPSC (induced pluripotent stem cell) generation, indicating that additional p53 targets may regulate this process. Here, we demonstrate that miR-34 microRNAs (miRNAs), particularly miR-34a, exhibit p53-dependent induction during reprogramming. Mir34a deficiency in mice significantly increased reprogramming efficiency and kinetics, with miR-34a and p21 cooperatively regulating somatic reprogramming downstream of p53. Unlike p53 deficiency, which enhances reprogramming at the expense of iPSC pluripotency, genetic ablation of Mir34a promoted iPSC generation without compromising self-renewal or differentiation. Suppression of reprogramming by miR-34a was due, at least in part, to repression of pluripotency genes, including Nanog, Sox2 and Mycn (also known as N-Myc). This post-transcriptional gene repression by miR-34a also regulated iPSC differentiation kinetics. miR-34b and c similarly repressed reprogramming; and all three miR-34 miRNAs acted cooperatively in this process. Taken together, our findings identified miR-34 miRNAs as p53 targets that play an essential role in restraining somatic reprogramming.},

  Abstract                 = {Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a CGG-repeat expansion that triggers hypermethylation and silencing of the FMR1 gene. FXS is referred to as the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, yet its true incidence has never been measured directly by large population screening. Here, we developed an inexpensive and high-throughput assay to quantitatively assess FMR1 methylation in DNA isolated from the dried blood spots of 36,124 deidentified newborn males. This assay displays 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity for detecting FMR1 methylation, successfully distinguishing normal males from males with full-mutation FXS. Furthermore, the assay can detect excess FMR1 methylation in 82% of females with full mutations, although the methylation did not correlate with intellectual disability. With amelogenin PCR used for detecting the presence of a Y chromosome, this assay can also detect males with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) (47, XXY). We identified 64 males with FMR1 methylation and, after confirmatory testing, found seven to have full-mutation FXS and 57 to have KS. Because the precise incidence of KS is known, we used our observed KS incidence as a sentinel to assess ascertainment quality and showed that our KS incidence of 1 in 633 newborn males was not significantly different from the literature incidence of 1 in 576 (p = 0.79). The seven FXS males revealed an FXS incidence in males of 1 in 5161 (95% confidence interval of 1 in 10,653-1 in 2500), consistent with some earlier indirect estimates. Given the trials now underway for possible FXS treatments, this method could be used in newborn or infant screening as a way of ensuring early interventions for FXS.},

Diverse studies have supported Haldane's contention of a higher average mutation rate in the male germline in a variety of mammals, including humans. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first direct comparative analysis of male and female germline mutation rates from the complete genome sequences of two parent-offspring trios. Through extensive validation, we identified 49 and 35 germline de novo mutations (DNMs) in two trio offspring, as well as 1,586 non-germline DNMs arising either somatically or in the cell lines from which the DNA was derived. Most strikingly, in one family, we observed that 92% of germline DNMs were from the paternal germline, whereas, in contrast, in the other family, 64% of DNMs were from the maternal germline. These observations suggest considerable variation in mutation rates within and between families.},

These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

  Abstract                 = {The gene PIG3 is induced by the tumor suppressor p53 but not by p53 mutants unable to induce apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in p53-mediated cell death. Here we show that p53 directly binds and activates the PIG3 promoter, but not through the previously described DNA element. Instead, p53 interacts with a pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence within the PIG3 promoter (TGYCC)n where Y=C or T. Despite its limited similarity to the p53-binding consensus, this sequence is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional activation of the PIG3 promoter by p53 and binds specifically to p53 in vitro and in vivo. In a population of 117 healthy donors from Germany, the microsatellite was found to be polymorphic, the number of pentanucleotide repeats being 10, 15, 16 or 17, and the frequency of alleles 5.1%, 62.0%, 21.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The number of repeats directly correlated with the extent of transcriptional activation by p53. This is the first time that a microsatellite has been shown to mediate the induction of a promoter through direct interaction with a transcription factor. Moreover, this sequence of PIG3 is the first p53-responsive element found to be polymorphic. Inheritance of this microsatellite may affect an individual's susceptibility to cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the astonishing increases in processor performance over the last 40 years, delivered application performance remains a critical issue for many important problems. Compilers play a critical role in determining that performance. A modern optimizing compiler contains many transformations that attempt to increase application performance. However, the best combination of transformations is an application-specific issue. Recent systems such as FFTW and ATLAS have demonstrated how code that adapts its behavior to target machine parameters can deliver better performance than code that adopts a single strategy for all machines. Unfortunately, developing these systems required significant amounts of time by experts. Adaptive compilation (systems where the compiler chooses an appropriate set of optimizations and parameters for each application) offer the promise of custom performance similar to FFTW or ATLAS without requiring the time investment of experts.
In this paper we detail an experiment with adaptive, feedback-driven blocksize choice. The experiment demonstrates two critical issues. First, an adaptive blocking strategy can automatically produce performance similar to that achieved by ATLAS. This result suggests that we can make customized ATLAS-like performance available, automatically, across a wider range of programs. Secondly, the command-line parametrization of existing commercial and research compilers is inadequate to express the complex strategies that an adaptive system will need. For example, the blocksize parameters to the MIPS compiler are applied uniformly to all loops; for more complex applications, the compiler will need to specify blocksizes on a much finer granularity.},

  Abstract                 = {Access to genetic data across studies is an important aspect of identifying new genetic associations through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Meta-analysis across multiple GWASs with combined cohort sizes of tens of thousands of individuals often uncovers many more genome-wide associated loci than the original individual studies; this emphasizes the importance of tools and mechanisms for data sharing. However, even sharing summary-level data, such as allele frequencies, inherently carries some degree of privacy risk to study participants. Here we discuss mechanisms and resources for sharing data from GWASs, particularly focusing on approaches for assessing and quantifying the privacy risks to participants that result from the sharing of summary-level data.},

Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites has traditionally represented the gold-standard experimental method for identifying regulatory elements, but the labor-intensive nature of this technique has limited its application to only a small number of human genes. We have developed a protocol to generate a genome-wide library of gene regulatory sequences by cloning DNase HS sites. We generated a library of DNase HS sites from quiescent primary human CD4(+) T cells and analyzed approximately 5600 of the resulting clones. Compared to sequences from randomly generated in silico libraries, sequences from these clones were found to map more frequently to regions of the genome known to contain regulatory elements, such as regions upstream of genes, within CpG islands, and in sequences that align between mouse and human. These cloned sites also tend to map near genes that have detectable transcripts in CD4(+) T cells, demonstrating that transcriptionally active regions of the genome are being selected. Validation of putative regulatory elements was achieved by repeated recovery of the same sequence and real-time PCR. This cloning strategy, which can be scaled up and applied to any cell line or tissue, will be useful in identifying regulatory elements controlling global expression differences that delineate tissue types, stages of development, and disease susceptibility.},

VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general Perl API.

The prototyped FODO-cell simulation is preparatory work for a larger, ongoing effort to model collective effects using a component-based version of the Synergia2 [12] beam dynamics framework. Synergia2 coordinates a suite of modeling services provided by two separate beam dynamics packages (Impact [10] and Chef) and two high-performance computer science packages (PETSc [3] and FFTW [7]). ne development of the proof-of-concept application was accomplished via the following tasks: 1) addressing multilanguage interoperability in the ML/I code with Babel; 2) creating the necessary components by making the selected software objects adhere to the CCA protocol; and 3) assemblying the components with a newly developed, Component Builder gui. The eventual, component-based beam dynamics application will allow the Synergia2 framework to evolve simultaneously with the modeling and simulation requirements of the International Linear Collider (ILC).},

However, it remains difficult to identify the causal variants underlying eQTLs, and little is known about the regulatory mechanisms by which they act. Here we show that genetic variants that modify chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding are a major mechanism through which genetic variation leads to gene expression differences among humans. We used DNase I sequencing to measure chromatin accessibility in 70 Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines, for which genome-wide genotypes and estimates of gene expression levels are also available. We obtained a total of 2.7 billion uniquely mapped DNase I-sequencing (DNase-seq) reads, which allowed us to produce genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility for each individual. We identified 8,902 locations at which the DNase-seq read depth correlated significantly with genotype at a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism or insertion/deletion (false discovery rate = 10%). We call such variants 'DNase I sensitivity quantitative trait loci' (dsQTLs). We found that dsQTLs are strongly enriched within inferred transcription factor binding sites and are frequently associated with allele-specific changes in transcription factor binding. A substantial fraction (16%) of dsQTLs are also associated with variation in the expression levels of nearby genes (that is, these loci are also classified as eQTLs). Conversely, we estimate that as many as 55% of eQTL single nucleotide polymorphisms are also dsQTLs. Our observations indicate that dsQTLs are highly abundant in the human genome and are likely to be important contributors to phenotypic variation.},

This same repeat expansion was identified in the majority of our families with a combined FTD/ALS phenotype and TDP-43-based pathology. Analysis of extended clinical series found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most common genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7%) and familial ALS (23.5%). The repeat expansion leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms. Our findings indicate that repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of both FTD and ALS.},

In humans, GRM5 levels are increased in certain pyramidal cell neurons in schizophrenics vs controls.(6) Finally, GRM5 has been mapped to 11q14, neighbouring a translocation that segregates with schizophrenia and related psychoses in a large Scottish family, F23 (MLOD score 6.0). We determined the intron/exon structure of GRM5 and identified a novel intragenic microsatellite. A case-control association study identified a significant difference in allele frequency distribution between schizophrenics and controls (P = 0.04). This is suggestive of involvement of the GRM5 gene in schizophrenia in this population.},

We use family inheritance state analysis to control sequencing error and inform family-wide haplotype phasing, allowing quantification of genome-wide compound heterozygosity. We develop a sequence-based methodology for Human Leukocyte Antigen typing that contributes to disease risk prediction. Finally, we advance methods for analysis of disease and pharmacogenomic risk across the coding and non-coding genome that incorporate phased variant data. We show these methods are capable of identifying multigenic risk for inherited thrombophilia and informing the appropriate pharmacological therapy.

Here we have addressed the hypothesis that a barrier element in vertebrates should be capable of defending a gene from silencing by DNA methylation. Using an established stable reporter gene system, we find that HS4 acts specifically to protect a gene promoter from de novo DNA methylation. Notably, protection from methylation can occur in the absence of histone acetylation or transcription. There is a division of labor at HS4; the sequences that mediate protection from methylation are separable from those that mediate CTCF-dependent enhancer blocking and USF-dependent histone modification recruitment. The zinc finger protein VEZF1 was purified as the factor that specifically interacts with the methylation protection elements. VEZF1 is a candidate CpG island protection factor as the G-rich sequences bound by VEZF1 are frequently found at CpG island promoters. Indeed, we show that VEZF1 elements are sufficient to mediate demethylation and protection of the APRT CpG island promoter from DNA methylation. We propose that many barrier elements in vertebrates will prevent DNA methylation in addition to blocking the propagation of repressive histone modifications, as either process is sufficient to direct the establishment of an epigenetically stable silent chromatin state.},

In this paper, we present the design of an annotation language, meant to be used either as an intermediate representation within library generators or directly by the programmer. This language that we call X represents parameterized programs in a compact and natural way. It provides an powerful optimization framework for high performance computing.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a parallel, cosmological N-body code based on a hybrid scheme using the particle-mesh (PM) and Barnes-Hut (BH) oct-tree algorithm. We call the algorithm GOTPM for Grid-of-Oct-Trees-Particle-Mesh. The code is parallelized using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library and is optimized to run on Beowulf clusters as well as symmetric multi-processors. The gravitational potential is determined on a mesh using a standard PM method with particle forces determined through interpolation. The softened PM force is corrected for short range interactions using a grid of localized BH trees throughout the entire simulation volume in a completely analogous way to (PM)-M-3 methods. This method makes no assumptions about the local density for short range force corrections and so is consistent with the results of the (PM)-M-3 method in the limit that the treecode opening angle parameter, theta-->0. The PM method is parallelized using one-dimensional slice domain decomposition. Particles are distributed in slices of equal width to allow mass assignment onto mesh points. The Fourier transforms in the PM method are done in parallel using the MPI implementation of the FFTW package. Parallelization for the tree force corrections is achieved again using one-dimensional slices but the width of each slice is allowed to vary according to the amount of computational work required by the particles within each slice to achieve load balance. The tree force corrections dominate the computational load and so imbalances in the PM density assignment step do not impact the overall load balance and performance significantly. The code performance scales well to 128 processors and is significantly better than competing methods. We present preliminary results from simulations run on different platforms containing up to N=1G particles to verify the code. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Current software such as X-Ray or LM-bench can automatically determine some of these parameters for single processor super-scalar machines but cannot determine multi-core specific characteristics.
In this paper, we present P-Ray, a software suite that characterizes hardware characteristics of multi-core architectures. Such characteristics include the number of cores that share the L2 cache, the different processors' interconnection topologies, and the bandwidth-to-memory.

  Abstract                 = {Microsatellite sequences are ubiquitous in the human genome and are important regulators of genome function. Here, we examine the mutational mechanisms governing the stability of highly abundant mono-, di-, and tetranucleotide microsatellites. Microsatellite mutation rate estimates from pedigree analyses and experimental models range from a low of approximately 10(-6) to a high of approximately 10(-2) mutations per locus per generation. The vast majority of observed mutational variation can be attributed to features intrinsic to the allele itself, including motif size, length, and sequence composition. A greater than linear relationship between motif length and mutagenesis has been observed in several model systems. Motif sequence differences contribute up to 10-fold to the variation observed in human cell mutation rates. The major mechanism of microsatellite mutagenesis is strand slippage during DNA synthesis. DNA polymerases produce errors within microsatellites at a frequency that is 10- to 100-fold higher than the frequency of frameshifts in coding sequences. Motif sequence significantly affects both polymerase error rate and specificity, resulting in strand biases within complementary microsatellites. Importantly, polymerase errors within microsatellites include base substitutions, deletions, and complex mutations, all of which produced interrupted alleles from pure microsatellites. Postreplication mismatch repair efficiency is affected by microsatellite motif size and sequence, also contributing to the observed variation in microsatellite mutagenesis. Inhibition of DNA synthesis within common microsatellites is highly sequence-dependent, and is positively correlated with the production of errors. DNA secondary structure within common microsatellites can account for some DNA polymerase pause sites, and may be an important factor influencing mutational specificity.},

To elucidate the molecular basis of microsatellite mutation, we have determined the in vitro polymerase error frequencies at microsatellite sequences representative of those found in the human genome: [GT/CA](10), [TC/AG](11), and [TTCC/AAGG](9). DNA templates contained the microsatellites inserted in-frame into the 5' region of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene. Polymerase beta (polbeta) error frequencies were quantitated in microsatellite sequences, relative to frame-shift error frequencies in coding sequences, from the same DNA synthesis reaction. The polbeta error frequencies within the dinucleotide sequences were (2-9) x 10(-3), 14-72-fold higher than the ssDNA template frequencies. The polbeta error frequencies within the tetranucleotide sequences were (4-6) x 10(-3), a 4-13-fold increase over background. Strand biases were observed for the [TC/AG](11) and [TTCC/AAGG](9) alleles, in which more errors were produced when the purine strand served as a template. Mutations within each microsatellite included noncanonical base substitution events and single nucleotide deletions as well as the expected unit length changes. An exponential relationship was observed between the polymerase error frequency per site and both the number of repetitive units and total length of the allele. Our observations are consistent with the strand slippage model of microsatellite mutagenesis and demonstrate that DNA sequence and/or structural differences result in mutational strand biases. To our knowledge, this is the first direct quantitation of DNA polymerase errors in vitro using template microsatellite sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {A variety of forensic, population, and disease studies are based on haploid DNA (e.g. mitochondrial DNA or Y-chromosome data). For any set of genetic markers databases of conventional size will normally contain only a fraction of all haplotypes. For several applications, reliable estimates of haplotype frequencies, the total number of haplotypes and coverage of the database (the probability that the next random haplotype is contained in the database) will be useful. We propose different approaches to the problem based on classical methods as well as new applications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We also discuss previous proposals based on saturation curves. Several conclusions can be inferred from simulated and real data. First, classical estimates of the fraction of unseen haplotypes can be seriously biased. Second, there is no obvious way to decide on required sample size based on traditional approaches. Methods based on testing of hypotheses or length of confidence intervals may appear artificial since no single test or parameter stands out as particularly relevant. Rather the coverage may be more relevant since it indicates the percentage of different haplotypes that are contained in a database; if the coverage is low, there is a considerable chance that the next haplotype to be observed does not appear in the database and this indicates that the database needs to be expanded.

  Abstract                 = {Although microsatellite polymorphisms are one of the most commonly used tools in genetic analyses, it remains to be understood how microsatellite DNA has evolved as a ubiquitous and highly abundant class of repetitive sequences in eukaryotic genomes. On the basis of analyses of spontaneous human microsatellite mutations of germline origin, I show here that different mutation biases underlie the evolution of microsatellite repeats. The within-locus mutation rate increases with allele length, but is not affected by the size difference between an individual's two alleles (allele span). Within loci, long alleles tend to mutate to shorter lengths, thereby acting to prevent infinite growth. Expansions are more common than contractions among dinucleotide repeats, whereas no such trend is evident among tetranucleotide repeats. This observation is consistent with the longer repeat lengths and higher frequency of di- compared with tetranucleotide repeats. An excess of paternally transmitted mutations (male-to-female ratio of 4.9) supports a male-biased mutation rate in the human genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Fast bit-reversal algorithms have been of strong interest for many decades, especially after Cooley and Tukey introduced their FFT implementation in 1965. Many recent algorithms, including FFTW try to avoid the bit-reversal all together by doing in place algorithms within their FFTs. We therefore motivate our work by showing that for FFTs of up to 65.536 points, a minimally tuned Cooley-Tukey FFT in C using our bit-reversal algorithm performs comparable or better than the default FFTW algorithm.
In this paper, the present an extremely fast linear bit-reversal adapted for modern multithreaded architectures. Our bit-reversal algorithm takes advantage of recursive calls combined with the fact that it only generates pairs of indices for which the corresponding elements need to be exchanges, thereby avoiding any explicit tests. In addition we have implemented an adaptive approach which explores the trade-off between compile time and run-time work load. By generating look-tip tables at compile tune, our algorithm becomes even faster at run-tinge. Our results also show that by using more than one thread on tightly coupled architectures,,further speed-up call be achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {Compilers employ system models, sometimes implicitly, to make code optimization decisions. These models are analytic; they reflect their implementor's understanding and beliefs of the system. While their decisions can be made almost instantaneously, unless the model is perfect their decisions may be flawed. To avoid exercising unique characteristics of a particular machine, such models are necessarily general and conservative. An alternative is to construct an empirical model. Building an empirical model involves extensive search of a parameter space to determine optimal settings. But this search is performed on the actual machine on which the compiler is to be deployed so that, once constructed, its decisions automatically reflect any eccentricities of the target system. Unfortunately, constructing accurate empirical models is expensive and, therefore, their applicability is limited to library generators such as ATLAS and FFTW. Here the high up-front installation cost can amortized over many future uses. In this paper we examine a hybrid approach. Active learning in an Explanation-Based paradigm allows the hybrid system to greatly increase the search range while drastically reducing the search time. Individual search points are analyzed for their information content using an known-imprecise qualitative analytic model. Next-search-points are chosen which have the highest expected information content with respect to refinement of the empirical model being constructed. To evaluate our approach we compare it with a leading analytic model and a leading empirical model. Our results show that the performance of the libraries generated using the hybrid approach is comparable to the performance of libraries generated via extensive search techniques and much better than that of the libraries generated by optimization based solely on an analytic model.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencers have sufficient power to analyze simultaneously DNAs from many different specimens, a practice known as multiplexing. Such schemes rely on the ability to associate each sequence read with the specimen from which it was derived. The current practice of appending molecular barcodes prior to pooling is practical for parallel analysis of up to many dozen samples. Here, we report a strategy that permits simultaneous analysis of tens of thousands of specimens. Our approach relies on the use of combinatorial pooling strategies in which pools rather than individual specimens are assigned barcodes. Thus, the identity of each specimen is encoded within the pooling pattern rather than by its association with a particular sequence tag. Decoding the pattern allows the sequence of an original specimen to be inferred with high confidence. We verified the ability of our encoding and decoding strategies to accurately report the sequence of individual samples within a large number of mixed specimens in two ways. First, we simulated data both from a clone library and from a human population in which a sequence variant associated with cystic fibrosis was present. Second, we actually pooled, sequenced, and decoded identities within two sets of 40,000 bacterial clones comprising approximately 20,000 different artificial microRNAs targeting Arabidopsis or human genes. We achieved greater than 97% accuracy in these trials. The strategies reported here can be applied to a wide variety of biological problems, including the determination of genotypic variation within large populations of individuals.},

  Abstract                 = {Whole exome sequencing has become a pivotal methodology for rapid and cost-effective detection of pathogenic variations in Mendelian disorders. A major challenge of this approach is determining the causative mutation from a substantial number of bystander variations that do not play any role in the disease etiology. Current strategies to analyze variations have mainly relied on genetic and functional arguments such as mode of inheritance, conservation, and loss of function prediction. Here, we demonstrate that disease-network analysis provides an additional layer of information to stratify variations even in the presence of incomplete sequencing coverage, a known limitation of exome sequencing. We studied a case of Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis (HSP) in a single inbred Palestinian family. HSP is a group of neuropathological disorders that are characterized by abnormal gait and spasticity of the lower limbs. Forty-five loci have been associated with HSP and lesions in 20 genes have been documented to induce the disorder. We used whole exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping to create a list of possible candidates. After exhausting the genetic and functional arguments, we stratified the remaining candidates according to their similarity to the previously known disease genes. Our analysis implicated the causative mutation in the motor domain of KIF1A, a gene that has not yet associated with HSP, which functions in anterograde axonal transportation. Our strategy can be useful for a large class of disorders that are characterized by locus heterogeneity, particularly when studying disorders in single families.},

Strategies include comparison of duplicate samples, independent calling of alleles, and Mendelian-inheritance-error checking. This study aimed to develop a better understanding of error types associated with microsatellite genotyping, as a first step toward development of a rational error-detection strategy. Two microsatellite marker sets (a commercial genomewide set and a custom-designed fine-resolution mapping set) were used to generate 118,420 and 22,500 initial genotypes and 10,088 and 8,328 duplicates, respectively. Mendelian-inheritance errors were identified by PedManager software, and concordance was determined for the duplicate samples. Concordance checking identifies only human errors, whereas Mendelian-inheritance-error checking is capable of detection of additional errors, such as mutations and null alleles. Neither strategy is able to detect all errors. Inheritance checking of the commercial marker data identified that the results contained 0.13% human errors and 0.12% other errors (0.25% total error), whereas concordance checking found 0.16% human errors. Similarly, Mendelian-inheritance-error checking of the custom-set data identified 1.37% errors, compared with 2.38% human errors identified by concordance checking. A greater variety of error types were detected by Mendelian-inheritance-error checking than by duplication of samples or by independent reanalysis of gels. These data suggest that Mendelian-inheritance-error checking is a worthwhile strategy for both types of genotyping data, whereas fine-mapping studies benefit more from concordance checking than do studies using commercial marker data. Maximization of error identification increases the likelihood of linkage when complex diseases are analyzed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, population-based regression models are proposed for high-resolution linkage disequilibrium mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Two regression models, the "genotype effect model" and the "additive effect model," are proposed to model the association between the markers and the trait locus. The marker can be either diallelic or multiallelic. If only one marker is used, the method is similar to a classical setting by Nielsen and Weir, and the additive effect model is equivalent to the haplotype trend regression (HTR) method by Zaykin et al. If two/multiple marker data with phase ambiguity are used in the analysis, the proposed models can be used to analyze the data directly. By analytical formulas, we show that the genotype effect model can be used to model the additive and dominance effects simultaneously; the additive effect model takes care of the additive effect only. On the basis of the two models, F-test statistics are proposed to test association between the QTL and markers. By a simulation study, we show that the two models have reasonable type I error rates for a data set of moderate sample size. The noncentrality parameter approximations of F-test statistics are derived to make power calculation and comparison. By a simulation study, it is found that the noncentrality parameter approximations of F-test statistics work very well. Using the noncentrality parameter approximations, we compare the power of the two models with that of the HTR. In addition, a simulation study is performed to make a comparison on the basis of the haplotype frequencies of 10 SNPs of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) provide powerful experimental tools by enabling stable and regulated gene silencing through programming of endogenous microRNA pathways. Since requirements for efficient shRNA biogenesis and target suppression are largely unknown, many predicted shRNAs fail to efficiently suppress their target. To overcome this barrier, we developed a "Sensor assay" that enables the biological identification of effective shRNAs at large scale. By constructing and evaluating 20,000 RNAi reporters covering every possible target site in nine mammalian transcripts, we show that our assay reliably identifies potent shRNAs that are surprisingly rare and predominantly missed by existing algorithms. Our unbiased analyses reveal that potent shRNAs share various predicted and previously unknown features associated with specific microRNA processing steps, and suggest a model for competitive strand selection. Together, our study establishes a powerful tool for large-scale identification of highly potent shRNAs and provides insights into sequence requirements of effective RNAi.},

Here, we describe a comparative genomic study of repetitive elements in developmental genes of 92 breeds of dogs. We find evidence for selection for divergence at coding repeat loci in the form of both elevated purity and extensive length polymorphism among different breeds. Variations in the number of repeats in the coding regions of the Alx-4 (aristaless-like 4) and Runx-2 (runt-related transcription factor 2) genes were quantitatively associated with significant differences in limb and skull morphology. We identified similar repeat length variation in the coding repeats of Runx-2, Twist, and Dlx-2 in several other species. The high frequency and incremental effects of repeat length mutations provide molecular explanations for swift, yet topologically conservative morphological evolution.},

The studied SIMD instruction set extensions include Intel's SSE family, AMD's 3DNow!, Motorola's AltiVec, and IBM's BlueGene/L SIMD instructions.

FFTW ATLAS, and SPIRAL demonstrate that near-optimal performance of numerical kernels across a variety of modern computers featuring deep memory hierarchies can be achieved only by means of automatic performance tuning. These software pack-ages generate and optimize ANSI C code and feed it into the target machine's general-purpose C compiler to maintain portability.
The scalar C code produced by performance tuning systems poses a severe challenge for vectorizing compilers. The particular code structure hampers automatic vectorization and, thus, inhibits satisfactory performance on processors featuring short vector extensions.
this paper describes special-purpose compiler technology that supports automatic performance tuning on machines with vector instructions. The work described includes; 1) symbolic vectorization of digital signal processing transforms; 2) straight-line code vectorization for numerical kernels; and 3) compiler back ends for straight-line code with vector,instructions.
Methods from all three areas were combined with FFTW. SPIRAL, and ATLAS to optimize both for memory hierarchy and vector instructions. Experiments show that the presented methods lead to substantial speedups (up to 1.8 for two-way and 3.3 for four-way vector extensions) over the best scalar C codes generated by the original systems as well as roughly matching the performance of hand-tuned vendor libraries.},

Then, we include the new FFT into the program generator Spiral to generate actual C implementations.

In particular, this includes the conversion of shuffle operations into array reindexings. To date, loop merging is well understood only for the DFT, and only for Cooley-Tukey FFT based algorithms, which excludes DFT sizes divisible by large primes. In this paper, we present a formal loop merging framework for general signal transforms and its implementation within the SPIRAL code generator. The framework consists of Sigma-SPL, a mathematical language to express loops and index mappings; a rewriting system to merge loops in E-SPL; and a compiler that translates Sigma-SPL into code. We apply the framework to DFT sizes that cannot be handled using only the Cooley-Tukey FFT and compare our method to FFTW 3.0.1 and the vendor library Intel MKL 7.2.1. Compared to FFTW our generated code is a factor of 2-4 faster under equal implementation conditions (same algorithms, same unrolling threshold). For some sizes we show a speed-up of a factor of 9 using Bluestein's algorithm. Further, we give a detailed comparison against the Intel vendor library MKL; our generated code is between 2 times faster and 4.5 times slower.},

  Abstract                 = {Improving human health is a major aim of medical research, but it requires that variation between individuals be taken into account since each person carries a different combination of gene variants and is exposed to different environmental conditions, which can cause differences in susceptibility to diseases. With the advent of molecular markers in the 1980s, it became possible to genotype individuals (i.e., to detect the presence or absence of local DNA sequence variants at each of hundreds of genome positions). This DNA sequence variation could then be related to disease susceptibility by using pedigree data. Such linkage analyses proved to be difficult for more complex diseases. Recently, with the decreasing costs of genotyping, analyses of large natural populations of unrelated individuals became possible and resulted in the association of many genes (and genetic variants in these genes) with complex diseases. Unfortunately, for a considerable proportion of these genes and their proteins, it is not yet clear what their downstream effects are. Studying the expression of these genes and proteins can help to uncover the effects of these variants on the expression of these and other genes, proteins, metabolites, and phenotypes. In this chapter, we focus on the high-throughput and genome-wide measurement of gene expression in a natural population of unrelated humans, and on the subsequent association of variation in expression to "expression quantitative trait loci" (eQTLs) on DNA using oligonucleotide arrays with hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that capture most of the human genetic variation well. This strategy has been successfully applied to several diseases such as celiac disease (Hunt et al. 2008, Nat Genet 40, 395-402) and asthma (Moffatt et al. 2007, Nature 448, 470-473): associated genetic variants have been identified that affect levels of gene expression in cis or in trans, providing insight into the biological pathways affected by these diseases.},

In FFTW, most of the performance-critical code was generated automatically by a special-purpose compiler, called genfft, that outputs C code. Written in Objective Caml, genfft can produce DFT programs for any input length, and it can specialize the DFT program for the common case where the input data are real instead of complex. Unexpectedly, genfft "discovered" algorithms that were previously unknown, and it was able to reduce the arithmetic complexity of some other existing algorithms. This paper describes the internals of this special-purpose compiler in some detail, and it argues that a specialized compiler is a valuable tool.},

  Abstract                 = {FFT literature has been mostly concerned with minimizing the number of floating-point operations performed by an algorithm. Unfortunately on present-day microprocessors this measure is far less important than it used to be, and interactions with the processor pipeline and the memory hierarchy have a larger impact on performance. Consequently, one must know the details of a computer architecture in order to design a fast algorithm. In this paper, we propose an adaptive FFT program that tunes the computation automatically for any particular hardware. We compared our program, called FFTW, with over 40 implementations of the FFT on 7 machines. Our tests show that FFTW's self-optimizing approach usually yields significantly better performance than all other publicly available software. FFTW also compares favorably with machine-specific, vendor-optimized libraries.},

We previously developed a method for reconstructing cell lineage trees from genomic variability caused by somatic mutations. Here, we apply the method to cancer and reconstruct, for the first time, a lineage tree of neoplastic and adjacent normal cells obtained by laser microdissection from tissue sections of a mouse lymphoma. Analysis of the reconstructed tree reveals that the tumor initiated from a single founder cell, approximately 5 months before diagnosis, that the tumor grew in a physically coherent manner, and that the average number of cell divisions accumulated in cancerous cells was almost twice than in adjacent normal lung epithelial cells but slightly less than the expected figure for normal B lymphocytes. The cells were also genotyped at the TP53 locus, and neoplastic cells were found to share a common mutation, which was most likely present in a heterozygous state. Our work shows that the ability to obtain data regarding the physical appearance, precise anatomic position, genotypic profile, and lineage position of single cells may be useful for investigating cancer development, progression, and interaction with the microenvironment.},

Its maintenance, further development and distribution is under the responsibility of the XMM-Newton Science Operations Centre together with the Survey Science Centre, representing a collaborative effort of more than 30 scientific institutes.
Developed in C++, Fortran 90/95 and Perl, the SAS makes large use of open software packages such as ds9 for image display (SAO-R&D Software Suite), Grace, LHEASOFT and cfitsio (HEASARC project), pgplot, fftw and the non-commercial version of Qt (TrollTech).
The combination of supporting several versions of SAS for multiple platforms (including SunOS, DEC, many Linux flavours and MacOS) in a widely distributed development process which makes use of a suite of external packages and libraries presents substantial issues for the integrity of the SAS maintenance and development. A further challenge comes from the necessity of maintaining the flexibility of a software package evolving together with progress made in instrument calibration and analysis refinement, whilst at the same time being the source of all official products of the XMM-Newton mission. To cope with this requirement, a sophisticated system for continuous integration and testing on several platforms of different branches has been put in place on top of a refined development model designed for this special S/W development case.
The SAS is considered now a mature system. We present the different aspects of its development, maintenance and distribution, extracting lessons learned for present and future projects of this magnitude.},

Using the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines, we combine 1000 Genomes genotypes and an extensive catalogue of human functional elements to investigate the biological mechanisms that eQTLs perturb. RESULTS: We use a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the enrichment of eQTLs in a wide variety of regulatory annotations. We find that approximately 40% of eQTLs occur in open chromatin, and that they are particularly enriched in transcription factor binding sites, suggesting that many directly impact protein-DNA interactions. Analysis of core promoter regions shows that eQTLs also frequently disrupt some known core promoter motifs but, surprisingly, are not enriched in other well-known motifs such as the TATA box. We also show that information from regulatory annotations alone, when weighted by the hierarchical model, can provide a meaningful ranking of the SNPs that are most likely to drive gene expression variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates how regulatory annotation and the association signal derived from eQTL-mapping can be combined into a single framework. We used this approach to further our understanding of the biology that drives human gene expression variation, and of the putatively causal SNPs that underlie it.},

We tested whether these CNVs were more likely to be functional than frequency-matched SNPs as trait-associated loci or as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) influencing phenotype by altering gene regulation. Our study found that CNV-tagging SNPs are significantly enriched for cis eQTLs; furthermore, we observed that trait associations from the NHGRI catalog show an overrepresentation of SNPs tagging CNVs relative to frequency-matched SNPs. We found that these SNPs tagging CNVs are more likely to affect multiple expression traits than frequency-matched variants. Given these findings on the functional relevance of CNVs, we created an online resource of expression-associated CNVs (eCNVs) using the most comprehensive population-based map of CNVs to inform future studies of complex traits. Although previous studies of common CNVs that can be typed on existing platforms and/or interrogated by SNPs in genome-wide association studies concluded that such CNVs appear unlikely to have a major role in the genetic basis of several complex diseases examined, our findings indicate that it would be premature to dismiss the possibility that even common CNVs may contribute to complex phenotypes and at least some common diseases.},

To identify regulatory DNA active in human pancreatic islets, we profiled chromatin by formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements coupled with high-throughput sequencing (FAIRE-seq). We identified approximately 80,000 open chromatin sites. Comparison of FAIRE-seq data from islets to that from five non-islet cell lines revealed approximately 3,300 physically linked clusters of islet-selective open chromatin sites, which typically encompassed single genes that have islet-specific expression. We mapped sequence variants to open chromatin sites and found that rs7903146, a TCF7L2 intronic variant strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, is located in islet-selective open chromatin. We found that human islet samples heterozygous for rs7903146 showed allelic imbalance in islet FAIRE signals and that the variant alters enhancer activity, indicating that genetic variation at this locus acts in cis with local chromatin and regulatory changes. These findings illuminate the tissue-specific organization of cis-regulatory elements and show that FAIRE-seq can guide the identification of regulatory variants underlying disease susceptibility.},

In experiments with polymerase chain reaction products that spanned a region of more than 4,000 base pairs and contained the promoter, two enhancers, and the polymorphic region in the first intron of the gene, we found that transcription activity declines with increasing numbers of CA dinucleotides. In vivo pre-mRNA expression data from cultured cell lines support these findings, although other regulation mechanisms can outweigh this effect. In addition, we showed that under our experimental conditions RNA elongation terminates at a site closely downstream of the simple sequence repeat and that there are two separate major transcription start sites.

Historically, tandem repeats have been designated as non functional "junk" DNA, mostly as a result of their highly unstable nature. With the exception of tandem repeats involved in human neurodegenerative diseases, repeat variation was often believed to be neutral with no phenotypic consequences. Recent studies, however, have shown that as many as 10% to 20% of coding and regulatory sequences in eukaryotes contain an unstable repeat tract. Contrary to initial suggestions, tandem repeat variation can have useful phenotypic consequences. Examples include rapid variation in microbial cell surface, tuning of internal molecular clocks in flies and the dynamic morphological plasticity in mammals.

However, as many as 10% to 20% of eukaryotic genes and promoters contain an unstable repeat tract. Mutations in these repeats often have fascinating phenotypic consequences. For example, changes in unstable repeats located in or near human genes can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington disease. Apart from their role in disease, variable repeats also confer useful phenotypic variability, including cell surface variability, plasticity in skeletal morphology, and tuning of the circadian rhythm. As such, TRs combine characteristics of genetic and epigenetic changes that may facilitate organismal evolvability.},

  Abstract                 = {The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is the cornerstone of many supercomputer applications and therefore needs careful performance tuning. Most often, however the real performance of the FFT implementations is far below the acceptable figures. In this paper we explore several strategies for performance optimisations of the FFT computation, such as enhancing instruction-level parallelism, loop merging, and reducing the memory loads and stores by using a special-purpose automatic loop unroller Our approach is based on the principle of complete unrolling which we apply to modify the FT kernel of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB). In experiments on two different IBM SP2 platforms, our automatically generated unrolled FFT subroutine is shown to improve the performance between 40% and 53% in comparison with the original code. Further the Execution time of the entire 3-D FFT mega-step of the benchmark is faster than when calls to a similar FFT subroutine from the vendor-optimised PESSL numerical library are used. Preliminary results suggest that the completely unrolled code also out performs FFTW, another high-performance FFT package. Finally: our approach for automatic generation of moderately optimised but specialised codes requires only a modest amount of programming effort.},

  Abstract                 = {Next generation sequencing can be used to search for Mendelian disease genes in an unbiased manner by sequencing the entire protein-coding sequence, known as the exome, or even the entire human genome. Identifying the pathogenic mutation amongst thousands to millions of genomic variants is a major challenge, and novel variant prioritization strategies are required. The choice of these strategies depends on the availability of well-phenotyped patients and family members, the mode of inheritance, the severity of the disease and its population frequency. In this review, we discuss the current strategies for Mendelian disease gene identification by exome resequencing. We conclude that exome strategies are successful and identify new Mendelian disease genes in approximately 60% of the projects. Improvements in bioinformatics as well as in sequencing technology will likely increase the success rate even further. Exome sequencing is likely to become the most commonly used tool for Mendelian disease gene identification for the coming years.},

The growth in genealogical registries may contribute to loss of privacy, given that genotypic information is accessible online to facilitate discovery of genetic relationships. Through iterative use of two such web archives, FamilySearch and Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation, I was able to discern the likely haplotypes for the Y chromosomes of two men, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, who were instrumental in the founding of the Latter-Day Saints Church. I then determined whether any of the Utahns who contributed to the HapMap project (the "CEU" set) is related to either man, on the basis of haplotype analysis of the Y chromosome. Although none of the CEU contributors appear to be a male-line relative, I discovered that predictions could be made for the surnames of the CEU participants by a similar process. For 20 of the 30 unrelated CEU samples, at least one exact match was revealed, and for 17 of these, a potential ancestor from Utah or a neighboring state could be identified. For the remaining ten samples, a match was nearly perfect, typically deviating by only one marker repeat unit. The same query performed in two other large databases revealed fewer individual matches and helped to clarify which surname predictions are more likely to be correct. Because large data sets of genotypes from both consenting research subjects and individuals pursuing genetic genealogy will be accessible online, this type of triangulation between databases may compromise the privacy of research subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {Synpolydactyly (SPD) is a dominantly inherited congenital limb malformation. Typical cases have 3/4 finger and 4/5 toe syndactyly, with a duplicated digit in the syndactylous web, but incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are common. The condition has recently been shown to be caused by expansions of an imperfect trinucleotide repeat sequence encoding a 15-residue polyalanine tract in HOXD13. We have studied 16 new and 4 previously published SPD families, with between 7 and 14 extra residues in the tract, to analyze the molecular basis for the observed variation in phenotype. Although there is no evidence of change in expansion size within families, even over six generations, there is a highly significant increase in the penetrance and severity of phenotype with increasing expansion size, affecting both hands (P = 0.012) and feet (P < 0. 00005). Affected individuals from a family with a 14-alanine expansion, the largest so far reported, all have a strikingly similar and unusually severe limb phenotype, involving the first digits and distal carpals. Affected males from this family also have hypospadias, not previously described in SPD, but consistent with HOXD13 expression in the developing genital tubercle. The remarkable correlation between phenotype and expansion size suggests that expansion of the tract leads to a specific gain of function in the mutant HOXD13 protein, and has interesting implications for the role of polyalanine tracts in the control of transcription.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled whole genome and transcriptome single nucleotide variant (SNV) discovery in cancer. NGS produces millions of short sequence reads that, once aligned to a reference genome sequence, can be interpreted for the presence of SNVs. Although tools exist for SNV discovery from NGS data, none are specifically suited to work with data from tumors, where altered ploidy and tumor cellularity impact the statistical expectations of SNV discovery. RESULTS: We developed three implementations of a probabilistic Binomial mixture model, called SNVMix, designed to infer SNVs from NGS data from tumors to address this problem. The first models allelic counts as observations and infers SNVs and model parameters using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and is therefore capable of adjusting to deviation of allelic frequencies inherent in genomically unstable tumor genomes. The second models nucleotide and mapping qualities of the reads by probabilistically weighting the contribution of a read/nucleotide to the inference of a SNV based on the confidence we have in the base call and the read alignment. The third combines filtering out low-quality data in addition to probabilistic weighting of the qualities. We quantitatively evaluated these approaches on 16 ovarian cancer RNASeq datasets with matched genotyping arrays and a human breast cancer genome sequenced to >40x (haploid) coverage with ground truth data and show systematically that the SNVMix models outperform competing approaches.

To improve linkage accuracy we studied different name comparison methods that establish agreement or disagreement between corresponding names.

The approximate comparators included the modified Jaro-Winkler method, the longest common substring, and the Levenshtein edit distance. We also calculated the combined root-mean square of all three. We tested each name comparison method using a deterministic record linkage algorithm. Results were consistent across both hospitals. At a threshold comparator score of 0.8, the Jaro-Winkler comparator achieved the highest linkage sensitivities of 97.4% and 97.7%. The combined root-mean square method achieved sensitivities higher than the Levenshtein edit distance or longest common substring while sustaining high linkage specificity. Approximate string comparators increase deterministic linkage sensitivity by up to 10% compared to exact match comparisons and represent an accurate method of linking to vital statistics data.},

Common variants regulating expression in cis have been mapped in many expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, typically in single tissues from unrelated individuals. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues conducted in a large set of mono- and dizygotic twins that allows systematic dissection of genetic (cis and trans) and non-genetic effects on gene expression. Using identity-by-descent estimates, we show that at least 40% of the total heritable cis effect on expression cannot be accounted for by common cis variants, a finding that reveals the contribution of low-frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility. We show that a substantial proportion of gene expression heritability is trans to the structural gene, and we identify several replicating trans variants that act predominantly in a tissue-restricted manner and may regulate the transcription of many genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Deciphering the ways in which somatic mutations and germline susceptibility variants cooperate to promote cancer is challenging. Ewing sarcoma is characterized by fusions between EWSR1 and members of the ETS gene family, usually EWSR1-FLI1, leading to the generation of oncogenic transcription factors that bind DNA at GGAA motifs. A recent genome-wide association study identified susceptibility variants near EGR2. Here we found that EGR2 knockdown inhibited proliferation, clonogenicity and spheroidal growth in vitro and induced regression of Ewing sarcoma xenografts. Targeted germline deep sequencing of the EGR2 locus in affected subjects and controls identified 291 Ewing-associated SNPs. At rs79965208, the A risk allele connected adjacent GGAA repeats by converting an interspaced GGAT motif into a GGAA motif, thereby increasing the number of consecutive GGAA motifs and thus the EWSR1-FLI1-dependent enhancer activity of this sequence, with epigenetic characteristics of an active regulatory element. EWSR1-FLI1 preferentially bound to the A risk allele, which increased global and allele-specific EGR2 expression. Collectively, our findings establish cooperation between a dominant oncogene and a susceptibility variant that regulates a major driver of Ewing sarcomagenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {The fusion between EWS and ETS family members is a key oncogenic event in Ewing tumors and important EWS-FLI1 target genes have been identified. However, until now, the search for EWS-FLI1 targets has been limited to promoter regions and no genome-wide comprehensive analysis of in vivo EWS-FLI1 binding sites has been undertaken. Using a ChIP-Seq approach to investigate EWS-FLI1-bound DNA sequences in two Ewing cell lines, we show that this chimeric transcription factor preferentially binds two types of sequences including consensus ETS motifs and microsatellite sequences. Most bound sites are found outside promoter regions. Microsatellites containing more than 9 GGAA repeats are very significantly enriched in EWS-FLI1 immunoprecipitates. Moreover, in reporter gene experiments, the transcription activation is highly dependent upon the number of repeats that are included in the construct. Importantly, in vivo EWS-FLI1-bound microsatellites are significantly associated with EWS-FLI1-driven gene activation. Put together, these results point out the likely contribution of microsatellite elements to long-distance transcription regulation and to oncogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Although simple tandem repeats (STRs) comprise ~2% of the human genome and represent an important source of polymorphism, this class of variation remains understudied. We have developed a cost-effective strategy for performing targeted enrichment of STR regions that utilizes capture probes targeting the flanking sequences of STR loci, enabling specific capture of DNA fragments containing STRs for subsequent high-throughput sequencing. Utilizing a capture design targeting 6,243 STR loci <94 bp and multiplexing eight individuals in a single Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing lane we were able to call genotypes in at least one individual for 67.5% of the targeted STRs. We observed a strong relationship between (G+C) content and genotyping rate. STRs with moderate (G+C) content were recovered with >90% success rate, whereas only 12% of STRs with >/= 80% (G+C) were genotyped in our assay. Analysis of a parent-offspring trio, complete hydatidiform mole samples, repeat analyses of the same individual, and Sanger sequencing-based validation indicated genotyping error rates between 7.6% and 12.4%. The majority of such errors were a single repeat unit at mono- or dinucleotide repeats. Altogether, our STR capture assay represents a cost-effective method that enables multiplexed genotyping of thousands of STR loci suitable for large-scale population studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) is an adaptive FFT library that generates highly efficient Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) implementations. It is one of the fastest FFT libraries available and it outperforms many adaptive or hand-tuned DFT libraries. Its success largely relies on the huge search space spanned by several FFT algorithms and a set of compiler generated C code (called codelets) for small size DFTs. FFTW empirically finds the best algorithm by measuring the performance of different algorithm combinations. Although the empirical search works very well for FFTW, the search process does not explain why the best plan found performs best, and the search overhead grows polynomially as the DFT size increases. The opposite of empirical search is model-driven optimization. However, it is widely believed that model-driven optimization is inferior to empirical search and is particularly powerless to solve problems as complex as the optimization of DFT.
In this paper, we propose a model-driven DFT performance predictor that can replace the empirical search engine in FFTW. Our technique adapts to different architectures and automatically predicts the performance of DFT algorithms and codelets (including SIMD codelets). Our experiments show that this technique renders DFT implementations that achieve more than 95% of the performance with the original FFTW and uses less than 5% of the search overhead on four test platforms. More importantly, our models give insight on why different combinations of DFT algorithms perform differently on a processor given its architectural features.},

We applied methods to partition the heritability explained by genotyped SNPs (h2g) across functional categories (while accounting for shared variance due to linkage disequilibrium) to genotype and imputed data for 11 common diseases. DNaseI Hypersensitivity Sites (DHS) from 218 cell-types, spanning 16% of the genome, explained an average of 79% of h2g (5.1× enrichment; P &lt; 10−20); further enrichment was observed at enhancer and cell-type specific DHS elements. The enrichments were much smaller in analyses that did not use imputed data or were restricted to GWAS- associated SNPs. In contrast, coding variants, spanning 1% of the genome, explained only 8% of h2g (13.8× enrichment; P = 5 × 10−4). We replicated these findings but found no significant contribution from rare coding variants in an independent schizophrenia cohort genotyped on GWAS and exome chips.Received April 18, 2014.Accepted April 20, 2014.© 2014, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressThis pre-print is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution 4.0 International), CC BY 4.0, as described at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/},

We also describe a way to determine the allelic state or genotype of each deletion polymorphism in each genome; the 1000 Genomes Project used this approach to type 13,826 deletion polymorphisms (48-995,664 bp) at high accuracy in populations.

  Abstract                 = {A developmental validation study was performed on three Y-STR multiplex systems, Multiplex III (MPIII), Multiplex IV (MPIV), and Multiplex V (MPV), to ascertain their potential applicability to forensic casework. MPIII contains eight Y-STRs, including DYS426, DYS435, DYS436, DYS441, DYS442, DYS446, DYS462, and Y-GATA-A10, and one InDel, YAP (DYS287). MPIV contains 21 Y-STR loci, including DYS443, DYS444, DYS445, DYS447, DYS448, DYS449, DYS452, DYS453, DYS454, DYS455, DYS456, DYS458, DYS463, DYS464, DYS468, DYS484, DYS522, DYS527, DYS531 DYS557, and DYS588.

Full genetic profiles were consistently obtained for all three multiplexes with 25-50 pg of male DNA. No significant amplification was observed with 1 mug of female DNA. Each multiplex permitted the determination of the number of male donors in male:male DNA admixtures. Species specificity studies demonstrated some cross-reactivity with some primate samples. Environmentally compromised blood samples produced full or partial profiles after exposure to various conditions for up to 1 year. Full profiles were recovered from simulated casework specimens including cigarette butts and postcoital cervicovaginal swabs. Population data were collected to determine individual loci gene diversity and multiplex discriminatory capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {Dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms ('microsatellites') are usually typed by resolving the products of PCR amplification on denaturing acrylamide gels. With this methodology, an allele consists not of a single fragment, but rather of a ladder of fragments, typically separated by intervals of 2nt. Mechanisms that have been invoked to explain the generation of these 'shadow bands' include slipped strand mispairing occurring during the PCR and artefactual 'recombination' caused by out-of-register annealing of truncated PCR products. The D11S527 locus contains the microsatellite sequence (GT)n(CTGT)m. By performing direct sequencing of PCR products derived from individuals homozygous at D11S527, we show that these products vary in length due solely to variations in the length of the dinucleotide repeat tract. These results rule out PCR recombination and support slipped strand mispairing as the major mechanism for generation of shadow bands.},

  Abstract                 = {Dinucleotide repeats are ubiquitous features of eukaryotic genomes that are not generally considered to have functional roles in gene expression. However, the highly variable nature of dinucleotide repeats makes them particularly interesting candidates for modifiers of RNA splicing when they are found near splicing signals. An example of a variable dinucleotide repeat that affects splicing is a TG repeat located in the splice acceptor of exon 9 of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Higher repeat numbers result in reduced exon 9 splicing efficiency and, in some instances, the reduction in full-length transcript is sufficient to cause male infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens or nonclassic cystic fibrosis. Using a CFTR minigene system, we studied TG tract variation and observed the same correlation between dinucleotide repeat number and exon 9 splicing efficiency seen in vivo. Replacement of the TG dinucleotide tract in the minigene with random sequence abolished splicing of exon 9. Replacements of the TG tract with sequences that can self-base-pair suggested that the formation of an RNA secondary structure was associated with efficient splicing. However, splicing efficiency was inversely correlated with the predicted thermodynamic stability of such structures, demonstrating that intermediate stability was optimal. Finally, substitution with TA repeats of differing length confirmed that stability of the RNA secondary structure, not sequence content, correlated with splicing efficiency. Taken together, these data indicate that dinucleotide repeats can form secondary structures that have variable effects on RNA splicing efficiency and clinical phenotype.},

Yet the ascertainment of the samples differs from most population-genetic studies which collect individuals who live in the same local region as their ancestors. What effects could this non-standard ascertainment have on the interpretation of HapMap results? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the HapMap samples with more conventionally-ascertained samples used in population- and forensic-genetic studies, including the HGDP-CEPH panel, making use of published genome-wide autosomal SNP data and Y-STR haplotypes, as well as producing new Y-STR data. We found that the HapMap samples were representative of their broad geographical regions of ancestry according to all tests applied. The YRI and JPT were indistinguishable from independent samples of Yoruba and Japanese in all ways investigated. However, both the CHB and the CEU were distinguishable from all other HGDP-CEPH populations with autosomal markers, and both showed Y-STR similarities to unusually large numbers of populations, perhaps reflecting their admixed origins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The CHB and JPT are readily distinguished from one another with both autosomal and Y-chromosomal markers, and results obtained after combining them into a single sample should be interpreted with caution. The CEU are better described as being of Western European ancestry than of Northern European ancestry as often reported. Both the CHB and CEU show subtle but detectable signs of admixture. Thus the YRI and JPT samples are well-suited to standard population-genetic studies, but the CHB and CEU less so.},

  Abstract                 = {In a genome-scale analysis of the composition of core promoter sequences, we have recently shown that approximately 25% of the human protein-coding genes have at least one short tandem repeat (STR) of 3-repeats in their core promoters (i.e. the interval between -120 to +1). Through their nucleosome processing effect, GA-repeats play a crucial role in the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, we chose the human SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 5 (SOX5) gene as a prototype of the GA-rich core promoters to investigate the role of core promoter GA-STRs in gene expression. The human SOX5 gene is indispensable for diverse embryonic developmental processes, ranging from oligodendrocyte development and corticogenesis to chondrogenesis, and regulation of the cell cycle. Whereas the absolute ratio of 99% of the genes range between 0.2 and 2, the composition of the core promoter of the two most ubiquitously expressed mRNAs of the human SOX5 gene (transcripts ID: ENST00000451604 and ENST00000309359) is exceptionally rich in purine nucleotides (purine/pyrimidine ratio: 61.5). Indeed, this core promoter is an island of four tandem GA-STRs, and lacks the known TATA and TATA-less elements for gene transcription. Evolutionary conservation of this region between human and mouse (75% homology) supports important functional role for this promoter. In this study, we show that this nucleotide composition is indeed a potent promoter (p<1x10(-10)), and different haplotypes across the region result in significant difference in gene expression (p<1x10(-6)). To our knowledge, this is the first report of functional STRs in a human gene core promoter. Based on our search on the core promoters of the entire human protein-coding genes annotated in the GeneCards database (19,927genes) for the presence of pure GA-STRs, 429 genes contain at least one GA(3)-repeat in their core promoter. Core promoters with pure GA-STRs of GA(4) and above were observed in 61 genes. Our data unravel a novel mechanism for inter-individual variation in gene expression and complex traits/phenotypes through core promoter GA-STRs.},

  Abstract                 = {Eukaryotic gene transcription is accompanied by acetylation and methylation of nucleosomes near promoters, but the locations and roles of histone modifications elsewhere in the genome remain unclear. We determined the chromatin modification states in high resolution along 30 Mb of the human genome and found that active promoters are marked by trimethylation of Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4), whereas enhancers are marked by monomethylation, but not trimethylation, of H3K4. We developed computational algorithms using these distinct chromatin signatures to identify new regulatory elements, predicting over 200 promoters and 400 enhancers within the 30-Mb region. This approach accurately predicted the location and function of independently identified regulatory elements with high sensitivity and specificity and uncovered a novel functional enhancer for the carnitine transporter SLC22A5 (OCTN2). Our results give insight into the connections between chromatin modifications and transcriptional regulatory activity and provide a new tool for the functional annotation of the human genome.},

In HSPCs, these sites tended to show intermediate, complex patterns that resolve to uniformity upon differentiation, by increased or decreased methylation. Promoter HMRs shared across diverse cell types typically display a constitutive core that expands and contracts in a lineage-specific manner to fine-tune the expression of associated genes. Many newly identified intergenic HMRs, both constitutive and lineage specific, were enriched for factor binding sites with an implied role in genome organization and regulation of gene expression, respectively. Overall, our studies represent an important reference data set and provide insights into directional changes in DNA methylation as cells adopt terminal fates.},

  Abstract                 = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder that affects millions worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 200 IBD-associated loci, but few have been conclusively resolved to specific functional variants. Here we report fine-mapping of 94 IBD loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. Of the 139 independent associations identified in these regions, 18 were pinpointed to a single causal variant with &gt;95% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with &gt;50% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for protein-coding changes (n=13), direct disruption of transcription factor binding sites (n=3) and tissue specific epigenetic marks (n=10), with the latter category showing enrichment in specific immune cells among associations stronger in CD and gut mucosa among associations stronger in UC. The results of this study suggest that high-resolution, fine-mapping in large samples can convert many GWAS discoveries into statistically convincing causal variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental elucidation of disease mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that support general purpose program are promising platforms for high performance computing. However, the fundamental architectural difference between GPU and CPU, the complexity of GPU platform and the diversity of GPU specifications have made the generation of highly efficient code for GPU increasingly difficult. Manual code generation is time consuming and the result tends to be difficult to debug and maintain. On the other hand, the code generated by today's GPU compiler often has much lower performance than the best hand-tuned codes. A promising code generation strategy, implemented by systems like ATLAS [14], FFTW [4], SPIRAL [11] and X-Sort [8], uses empirical search to find the parameter values of the implementation, such as the the size and instruction schedules, that deliver near-optimal performance for a particular machine. However, this approach has only proved successful when applied to CPU where the performance of CPU programs has been relatively better understood. Clearly, empirical search must be extended to general purpose programs on GPU.
In this paper, we propose an empirical optimization technique for one of the most important sorting routines on GPU, the radix sort, that generates highly efficient code for a number of representative NVIDIA GPUs with a wide variety of architectural specifications. Our study has been focused on the algorithmic parameters of radix sort that can be adapted to different environments and the GPU architectural factors that affect the performance of radix sort. We present a powerful empirical optimization approach that is shown to be able to find highly efficient code for different NVIDIA GPUs. Our results show that such an empirical optimization approach is quite effective at taking into account the complex interactions between architectural characteristics and that the resulting code performs significantly better than two radix sort implementations that have been shown outperforming other GPU sort routines with the maximal speedup of 33.4%.},

Here, we analyzed the position requirements of this CA-repeat element, which revealed its potential role in alternative splicing. In addition, we defined the RNA binding specificity of hnRNP L by SELEX: not only regular CA repeats are recognized with high affinity but also certain CA-rich clusters. Therefore, we have systematically searched the human genome databases for CA-repeat and CA-rich elements associated with alternative 5' splice sites (5'ss), followed by minigene transfection assays. Surprisingly, in several specific human genes that we tested, intronic CA RNA elements could function either as splicing enhancers or silencers, depending on their proximity to the alternative 5'ss. HnRNP L was detected specifically bound to these diverse CA elements. These data demonstrated that intronic CA sequences constitute novel and widespread regulatory elements of alternative splicing.},

We identify the 65 kDa heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) L as the major factor that binds specifically and in a length-dependent manner to the CA-repeat enhancer. In addition, we show that hnRNP L functions as a specific activator of eNOS splicing, providing the first evidence for a role of hnRNP L in the regulation of mRNA splicing.

In this environment, broad dissemination of results from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or deep-sequencing efforts is highly desirable. However, summary results from case-control studies (allele frequencies) have been withdrawn from public access because it has been shown that they can be used for inferring participation in a study if the individual's genotype is available. A natural question that follows is how much private information is contained in summary results from quantitative trait GWAS such as regression coefficients or p values. We show that regression coefficients for many SNPs can reveal the person's participation and for participants his or her phenotype with high accuracy. Our power calculations show that regression coefficients contain as much information on individuals as allele frequencies do, if the person's phenotype is rather extreme or if multiple phenotypes are available as has been increasingly facilitated by the use of multiple-omics data sets. These findings emphasize the need to devise a mechanism that allows data sharing that will facilitate scientific progress without sacrificing privacy protection.},

The first is the popular exact FFT implementation FFTW Version 3. 1. The second is an implementation of FADFT-2's ancestor, FADFT-1. Experiments verify the theoretical runtimes of both FADFT-1 and FADFT-2. In doing so it is shown that FADFT-2 not only generally outperforms FADFT-1 on all but the sparsest signals, but is also significantly faster than FFTW 3.1 on large sparse signals. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that FADFT-2 is indistinguishable from FADFT-1 in terms of noise tolerance despite FADFT-2's better execution time.},

Using a likelihood-based statistical framework, we developed an improved statistic that uses genotype frequencies and individual genotypes to infer whether a specific individual or any close relatives participated in the GWAS and, if so, what the participant's phenotype status is. Our statistic compares the logarithm of genotype frequencies, in contrast to that of Homer et al., which is based on differences in either SNP probe intensity or allele frequencies.

Compared to di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats, STRs with longer repeat units occur more rarely and are far less commonly used. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to study the evolutionary dynamics of STRs according to repeat unit size, we analysed variation at 24 Y chromosome repeat loci: 1 tri-, 14 tetra-, 7 penta-, and 2 hexanucleotide loci. According to our results, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats have approximately two times lower repeat variance and diversity than tri- and tetranucleotide repeats, indicating that their mutation rate is about half of that of tri- and tetranucleotide repeats. Thus, STR markers with longer repeat units are more robust in distinguishing Y chromosome haplogroups and, in some cases, phylogenetic splits within established haplogroups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Y chromosome STRs of increased repeat unit size have a lower rate of evolution, which has significant relevance in population genetic and evolutionary studies.},

We describe a survey of worldwide populations for further instances of this deletion. Of 859 males tested, 55 (approximately 6%) show absence of the 50f2/C locus; duplication of the locus was also detected in eight out of 595 males (approximately 1.4%). Populations having the deletion are confined to Asia, Australasia, and southern and northern Europe; of those of reasonable sample size, Finns had the highest deletion frequency (55%; n = 21). The deletions vary in size and the larger ones remove some of the RBM (RNA Binding Motif) genes, but none of the deletion males lack DAZ (Deleted in AZoospermia), a candidate gene for the azoospermia factor. On a tree of Y haplotypes, 28 deletion and eight duplication chromosomes fall into six and four haplotypic groups respectively, each of which is likely to represent an independent deletion or duplication event. Microsatellite and other haplotyping data suggest the existence of at least two further classes of deletion. Thus duplications and deletions in this region of Yq have occurred many times in human evolution, but remain useful markers for paternal lineages.},

Only minor modifications are required to compute transforms with different dimension. These modifications were incorporated into the FFTW package so that the algorithm for computing one-dimensional transforms can be used to compute arbitrary dimensional transforms. This reduced the runtime of many multi-dimensional transforms.},

  Abstract                 = {RNAi has existed at least since the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This collection of pathways responds to a diversity of "abberant" RNAs and generally silences or eliminates genes sharing sequence content with the silencing trigger. In the canonical pathway, double-stranded RNAs are processed into small RNAs, which guide effector complexes to their targets by complementary base pairing. Many alternative routes from silencing trigger to small RNA are continuously being uncovered. Though the triggers of the pathway and the mechanisms of small RNA production are many, all RNAi-related mechanisms share Argonaute proteins as the heart of their effector complexes. These can act as self-contained silencing machines, binding directly to small RNAs, carrying out homology-based target recognition, and in some cases cleaving targets using an endogenous nuclease domain. Here, we discuss the diversity of Argonaute proteins from a structural and functional perspective.},

The Browser's web-based tools provide an integrated environment for visualizing, comparing, analysing and sharing both publicly available and user-generated genomic data sets. As of September 2013, the database contained genomic sequence and a basic set of annotation 'tracks' for approximately 90 organisms. Significant new annotations include a 60-species multiple alignment conservation track on the mouse, updated UCSC Genes tracks for human and mouse, and several new sets of variation and ENCODE data. New software tools include a Variant Annotation Integrator that returns predicted functional effects of a set of variants uploaded as a custom track, an extension to UCSC Genes that displays haplotype alleles for protein-coding genes and an expansion of data hubs that includes the capability to display remotely hosted user-provided assembly sequence in addition to annotation data. To improve European access, we have added a Genome Browser mirror (http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu) hosted at Bielefeld University in Germany.},

  Abstract                 = {We have screened the nearly complete DNA sequence of the human Y chromosome for microsatellites (short tandem repeats) that meet the criteria of having a repeat-unit size of > or = 3 and a repeat count of > or = 8 and thus are likely to be easy to genotype accurately and to be polymorphic. Candidate loci were tested in silico for novelty and for probable Y specificity, and then they were tested experimentally to identify Y-specific loci and to assess their polymorphism. This yielded 166 useful new Y-chromosomal microsatellites, 139 of which were polymorphic, in a sample of eight diverse Y chromosomes representing eight Y-SNP haplogroups. This large sample of microsatellites, together with 28 previously known markers analyzed here--all sharing a common evolutionary history--allowed us to investigate the factors influencing their variation. For simple microsatellites, the average repeat count accounted for the highest proportion of repeat variance (approximately 34%). For complex microsatellites, the largest proportion of the variance (again, approximately 34%) was explained by the average repeat count of the longest homogeneous array, which normally is variable. In these complex microsatellites, the additional repeats outside the longest homogeneous array significantly increased the variance, but this was lower than the variance of a simple microsatellite with the same total repeat count. As a result of this work, a large number of new, highly polymorphic Y-chromosomal microsatellites are now available for population-genetic, evolutionary, genealogical, and forensic investigations.},

We genotyped DYS464 in 677 male samples collected worldwide, maintained in the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel. Fourteen different alleles were found, with allele lengths varying from 9 to 23 repeats. One hundred and seventy-five different genotypes were detected, of which 90 appeared to be continent-specific. The region with the highest percentage of unique genotypes was Africa. Genotype diversity was 0.98 for Europe, 0.97 for Central and East Asia, 0.95 for Africa, 0.94 for Oceania, 0.92 for the Middle East, and 0.90 for the Americas. A hierarchical analysis of molecular variance showed low levels of worldwide genetic structure; 88.42% of the genetic variance was found within populations, 9.62% between populations within regions and 1.96% between regions. Since the four DYS464 repeats are identical, one cannot assign each peak in the electropherogram to a specific locus. Thus, the same genotype may correspond to several haplotypes, with different permutations of alleles. Consequently, genotypes are degenerate, which limits phylogeographical analyses. Yet, because of its high variability, DYS464 still constitutes an informative tool for population and evolutionary studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on feedback information, a large number of optimizations can be performed by the compiler. This information actually indicates the changing behavior of the applications and can be used to specialize code accordingly.
Code specialization is a way to facilitate the compiler to perform optimizations by providing the information regarding variables in the code. It is however difficult to select the variables which maximize the benefit of specialization. Also the overhead of specialization and code size increase are the main issues while specializing code.
This paper suggests a novel method for improving the performance using specialization based on feedback information and analysis. The code is iteratively specialized after selecting candidate variables by using a heuristic, followed by generation of optimized templates. These templates require a limited set of instructions to be specialized at runtime and are valid for a large number of values. The overhead of runtime specialization is further minimized through optimal software cache of template clones whose instantiation can be performed at static compile time.
The experiments have been performed on Itanium-II(IA-64) and Pentium-IV processors using icc and gcc compilers. A significant improvement in terms of execution speed and reduction of code size has been achieved for SPEc and FFTw benchmarks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {To fully exploit the instruction-level parallelism offered by modern processors, compilers need the necessary information available during the execution of the program. This advocates for iterative or dynamic Compilation. Unfortunately, dynamic compilation is suitable only for applications where the cost of compilation may be amortized by multiple invocations of the same code. Similarly, the cost of iterative compilation makes it impractical to be widely used for performance improvement. In this article, we suggest a novel approach for improving the performance of mathematical kernels through fast instantiations of templates. Optimized templates are generated at static compile time with a limited number of compilations. The initial instantiations of these templates are performed at static compile time, and the runtime instantiations are performed with a very small overhead through specialized data, requiring no computations at runtime. It represents an effective solution in terms of reduced overhead incurring at static compile time and dynamic compile time.

  Abstract                 = {Surnames are cultural markers of shared ancestry within human populations. The Y chromosome, like many surnames, is paternally inherited, so men sharing surnames might be expected to share similar Y chromosomes as a signature of coancestry. Such a relationship could be used to connect branches of family trees, to validate population genetic studies based on isonymy, and to predict surname from crime-scene samples in forensics. However, the link may be weak or absent due to multiple independent founders for many names, adoptions, name changes and nonpaternities, and mutation of Y haplotypes. Here, rather than focusing on a single name, we take a general approach by seeking evidence for a link in a sample of 150 randomly ascertained pairs of males who each share a British surname. We show that sharing a surname significantly elevates the probability of sharing a Y-chromosomal haplotype and that this probability increases as surname frequency decreases. Within our sample, we estimate that up to 24% of pairs share recent ancestry and that a large surname-based forensic database might contribute to the intelligence-led investigation of up to approximately 70 rapes and murders per year in the UK. This approach would be applicable to any society that uses patrilineal surnames of reasonable time-depth.},

These unique cultural markers of coancestry might therefore have a genetic correlate in shared Y chromosome types among men sharing surnames, although the link could be affected by mutation, multiple foundation for names, nonpaternity, and genetic drift. Here, we demonstrate through an analysis of 1,678 Y-chromosomal haplotypes within 40 British surnames a remarkably high degree of coancestry that generally increases as surnames become rarer. On average, the proportion of haplotypes lying within descent clusters is 62% but ranges from 0% to 87%. The shallow time depth of many descent clusters within names, the lack of a detectable effect of surname derivation on diversity, and simulations of surname descent suggest that genetic drift through variation in reproductive success is important in structuring haplotype diversity. Modern patterns therefore provide little reliable information about the original founders of surnames some 700 years ago. A comparative analysis of published data on Y diversity within Irish surnames demonstrates a relative lack of surname frequency dependence of coancestry, a difference probably mediated through distinct Irish and British demographic histories including even more marked genetic drift in Ireland.},

In addition, choosing between two standard implementations of complex multiplication produces results that match each of the two algorithms.

We present VarScan, an open source tool for variant detection that is compatible with several short read aligners.

With the help of the second fix, FixGFMD, the coefficients obtained from FixGFC can then be used to compute the elastic forces for a (large) block of the same material.

Nature of problem: Using molecular dynamics to study elastically deforming solids imposes very high computational costs because portions of the solid far away from the interface or contact points need to be included in the simulation to reproduce the effects of long-range elastic deformations. Green's function molecular dynamics (GFMD) incorporates the full elastic response of semi-infinite solids so that only surface atoms have to be considered in molecular dynamics simulations, thus reducing the problem from three dimensions to two dimensions without compromising the physical essence of the problem. Solution method: See "Nature of problem".
Restrictions: The mean equilibrium positions of the GFMD surface atoms must be in a plane and be periodic in the plane, so that the Born-von Karman boundary condition can be used. In addition, only deformation within the harmonic regime is expected in the surface layer during Green's function molecular dynamics.
Running time: FixGFC varies from minutes to days, depending on the system size, the numbers of processors used, and the complexity of the force field. FixGFMD varies from seconds to days depending on the system size and numbers of processors used. References: [1] C. Campana, M.H. Muser, Phys. Rev. B 74 (2006) 075420. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the previous implementation, the effective elastic coefficients measured at the Gamma-point were altered to reduce finite size effects: their eigenvalues corresponding to the acoustic modes were set to zero. This scheme was found to work well for simple Bravais lattices as long as only atoms within the last layer were treated as Green's function atoms. However, it failed to function as expected in all other cases. It turns out that a violation of the acoustic sum rule for the effective elastic coefficients at Gamma (Kong, 2010 [3]) was responsible for this behavior. In the new version, the acoustic sum rule is enforced by adopting an iterative procedure, which is found to be physically more meaningful than the previous one. In addition, the new algorithm allows one to treat lattices with bases and the Green's function slab is no longer confined to one layer.

Nature of problem: Green's function molecular dynamics (GFMD) is a coarse-graining method that enables one to investigate the full elastic response of an interface between a semi-infinite solid and a contact while taking only the surface atoms in the solid into consideration. The effect of long-range elastic deformations on the surface atoms from the semi-infinite solid is replaced by effective elastic interactions, thus reducing the problem from three dimensions to two dimensions without compromising the physical essence of the problem.},

Recently, long TGG repeat tracts were shown to be implicated in a genomic disorder resulting from chromosome 14q32.2 deletion. Various different mechanisms might trigger this deletion, and looking at the problem from a structural biology perspective may help. Deeper insight into repeated sequences and their features may shed light on the mechanisms involved in this microdeletion and similar genomic rearrangements.},

While several reliable algorithms are available for automated SNV detection, the automated detection of microindels in deep short-read data presents a new bioinformatics challenge. RESULTS: We systematically analyzed how the short-read mapping tools MAQ, Bowtie, Burrows-Wheeler alignment tool (BWA), Novoalign and RazerS perform on simulated datasets that contain indels and evaluated how indels affect error rates in SNV detection. We implemented a simple algorithm to compute the equivalent indel region eir, which can be used to process the alignments produced by the mapping tools in order to perform indel calling. Using simulated data that contains indels, we demonstrate that indel detection works well on short-read data: the detection rate for microindels (<4 bp) is >90%. Our study provides insights into systematic errors in SNV detection that is based on ungapped short sequence read alignments. Gapped alignments of short sequence reads can be used to reduce this error and to detect microindels in simulated short-read data. A comparison with microindels automatically identified on the ABI Sanger and Roche 454 platform indicates that microindel detection from short sequence reads identifies both overlapping and distinct indels.

We describe two human cases of pediatric cataract with loss-of-function mutations in TDRD7 and demonstrate that Tdrd7 nullizygosity in mouse causes cataracts, as well as glaucoma and an arrest in spermatogenesis. TDRD7 is a Tudor domain RNA binding protein that is expressed in lens fiber cells in distinct TDRD7-RGs that interact with STAU1-ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). TDRD7 coimmunoprecipitates with specific lens messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and is required for the posttranscriptional control of mRNAs that are critical to normal lens development and to RG function.

In contrast, 26.5% of indels were concordant between platforms. Target enrichment validated 92.7% of the concordant SNVs, whereas validation by genotyping array revealed a sensitivity of 99.3%. The validation experiments also suggested that >60% of the platform-specific variants were indeed present in the genome.

In a combined dataset of both studies, the sum of STR alleles was regressed on each phenotype, adjusted for age and sex. The association analyses were repeated for SNPs in a 200 kb region surrounding the respective STRs in the KORA F4 Study. Three STRs were significantly associated with total cholesterol (within LDLR, the APOA1/C3/A4/A5/BUD13 gene region and ABCG5/8), five with HDL cholesterol (3 within CETP, one in LPL and one inAPOA1/C3/A4/A5/BUD13), three with LDL cholesterol (LDLR, ABCG5/8 and CETP) and two with triglycerides (APOA1/C3/A4/A5/BUD13 and LPL). None of the investigated STRs, however, showed a significant association after adjusting for the lead or adjacent SNPs within that gene region. The evaluated STRs were found to be well tagged by the lead SNP within the respective gene regions. Therefore, the STRs reflect the association signals based on surrounding SNPs. In conclusion, none of the STRs contributed additionally to the SNP-based association signals identified in GWAS on lipid traits.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome sequencing projects are discovering millions of genetic variants in humans, and interpretation of their functional effects is essential for understanding the genetic basis of variation in human traits. Here we report sequencing and deep analysis of messenger RNA and microRNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines of 462 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project--the first uniformly processed high-throughput RNA-sequencing data from multiple human populations with high-quality genome sequences. We discover extremely widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci. Altogether, this study provides a deep understanding of the cellular mechanisms of transcriptome variation and of the landscape of functional variants in the human genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Expansion of the trinucleotide repeat (CAG)n in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene is associated with a rare motor neuron disorder, X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. We have found that expanded (CAG)n alleles undergo alteration in length when transmitted from parent to offspring. Of 45 meioses examined, 12 (27%) demonstrated a change in CAG repeat number. Both expansions and contractions were observed, although their magnitude was small. There was a greater rate of instability in male meiosis than in female meiosis. We also found evidence for a correlation between disease severity and CAG repeat length, but other factors seem to contribute to the phenotypic variability in this disorder.},

Secondly, 8 markers were selected on the basis of high gene diversity values reported for several population studies, and thirdly 19 markers were chosen from a survey of Y-chromosome sequence with selections made primarily on the basis of the number of repeated elements present. Samples were typed from 101 English-speaking Caucasians, 88 Xhosa individuals and 77 Asian Indians.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Microsatellites are short, tandemly-repeated DNA sequences which are widely distributed among genomes. Their structure, role and evolution can be analyzed based on exhaustive extraction from sequenced genomes. Several dedicated algorithms have been developed for this purpose. Here, we compared the detection efficiency of five of them (TRF, Mreps, Sputnik, STAR, and RepeatMasker). RESULTS: Our analysis was first conducted on the human X chromosome, and microsatellite distributions were characterized by microsatellite number, length, and divergence from a pure motif. The algorithms work with user-defined parameters, and we demonstrate that the parameter values chosen can strongly influence microsatellite distributions. The five algorithms were then compared by fixing parameters settings, and the analysis was extended to three other genomes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa and Drosophila melanogaster) spanning a wide range of size and structure. Significant differences for all characteristics of microsatellites were observed among algorithms, but not among genomes, for both perfect and imperfect microsatellites. Striking differences were detected for short microsatellites (below 20 bp), regardless of motif. CONCLUSION: Since the algorithm used strongly influences empirical distributions, studies analyzing microsatellite evolution based on a comparison between empirical and theoretical size distributions should therefore be considered with caution. We also discuss why a typological definition of microsatellites limits our capacity to capture their genomic distributions.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is present in approximately 80% of human Merkel cell carcinomas (MCCs). A previous in silico prediction suggested MCPyV encodes a microRNA (miRNA) that may regulate cellular and viral genes. OBJECTIVES: To determine the presence and prevalence of a putative MCPyV-encoded miRNA in human MCC tumors. STUDY DESIGN: Over 30 million small RNAs from 7 cryopreserved MCC tumors and 1 perilesional sample were sequenced. 45 additional MCC tumors were examined for expression of an MCPyV-encoded mature miRNA by reverse transcription real-time PCR. RESULTS: An MCPyV-encoded mature miRNA, "MCV-miR-M1-5p", was detected by direct sequencing in 2 of 3 MCPyV-positive MCC tumors. Although a precursor miRNA, MCV-miR-M1, had been predicted in silico and studied in vitro by Seo et al., no MCPyV-encoded miRNAs have been directly detected in human tissues. Importantly, the mature sequence of MCV-miR-M1 found in vivo was identical in all 79 reads obtained but differed from the in silico predicted mature miRNA by a 2-nucleotide shift, resulting in a distinct seed region and a different set of predicted target genes. This mature miRNA was detected by real-time PCR in 50% of MCPyV-positive MCCs (n=38) and in 0% of MCPyV-negative MCCs (n=13). CONCLUSIONS: MCV-miR-M1-5p is expressed at low levels in 50% of MCPyV-positive MCCs. This virus-encoded miRNA is predicted to target genes that may play a role in promoting immune evasion and regulating viral DNA replication.},

  Abstract                 = {Presented here is a genome sequence of an individual human. It was produced from approximately 32 million random DNA fragments, sequenced by Sanger dideoxy technology and assembled into 4,528 scaffolds, comprising 2,810 million bases (Mb) of contiguous sequence with approximately 7.5-fold coverage for any given region. We developed a modified version of the Celera assembler to facilitate the identification and comparison of alternate alleles within this individual diploid genome. Comparison of this genome and the National Center for Biotechnology Information human reference assembly revealed more than 4.1 million DNA variants, encompassing 12.3 Mb. These variants (of which 1,288,319 were novel) included 3,213,401 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 53,823 block substitutions (2-206 bp), 292,102 heterozygous insertion/deletion events (indels)(1-571 bp), 559,473 homozygous indels (1-82,711 bp), 90 inversions, as well as numerous segmental duplications and copy number variation regions. Non-SNP DNA variation accounts for 22% of all events identified in the donor, however they involve 74% of all variant bases. This suggests an important role for non-SNP genetic alterations in defining the diploid genome structure. Moreover, 44% of genes were heterozygous for one or more variants. Using a novel haplotype assembly strategy, we were able to span 1.5 Gb of genome sequence in segments >200 kb, providing further precision to the diploid nature of the genome. These data depict a definitive molecular portrait of a diploid human genome that provides a starting point for future genome comparisons and enables an era of individualized genomic information.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

Library generators such as ATLAS, SPIRAL, and FFTW address this problem by using empirical search to find the parameter values of certain optimization such as degree of unroll. We have recently developed a generator of sorting routines. Sorting differs from the algorithms implemented by other library generators in that performance of sorting depends not only on the target platform but also on the characteristics of the input data. In our work we used a classifier learning system to generate sorting routines that are capable of adapting to the input data. In this paper we follow a similar approach and use a classifier learning system to generate high performance libraries for matrix-matrix multiplication. Our library generator produces matrix multiplication routines that use recursive layouts and several levels of tiling. Our approach is to use a classifier learning system to search in the space of the different ways to partition the input matrices the one that performs the best. As a result, our system will determine the number of levels of tiling and tile size for each level depending on the target platform and the dimensions of the input matrices.},

  Abstract                 = {Empirical search is a strategy used during the installation of library generators such as ATLAS, FFTW, and SPIRAL to identify the algorithm or the version of an algorithm that delivers the best performance. In the past, empirical search has been applied almost exclusively to scientific problems. In this paper, we discuss the application of empirical search to sorting, which is one of the best understood symbolic computing problems. When contrasted with the dense numerical computations of ATLAS, FFTW, and SPIRAL, sorting presents a new challenge, namely that the relative performance of the algorithms depend not only on the characteristics of the target machine and the size of the input data but also on the distribution of values in the input data set.
Empirical search is applied in the study reported here as part of a sorting library generator. The resulting routines dynamically adapt to the characteristics of the input data by selecting the best sorting algorithm from a small set of alternatives. To generate the run time selection mechanism our generator makes use of machine learning to predict the best algorithm as a function of the characteristics of the input data set and the performance of the different algorithms on the target machine. This prediction is based on the data obtained through empirical search at installation time.
Our results show that our approach is quite effective. When sorting data inputs of 12M keys with various standard deviations, our adaptive approach selected the best algorithm for all the input data sets and all platforms that we tried in our experiments. The wrong decision could have introduced a performance degradation of up to 133%, with an average value of 44%.},

  Abstract                 = {The growing complexity of modern processors has made the generation of highly efficient code increasingly difficult. Manual code generation is very time consuming, but it is often the only choice since the code generated by today's compiler technology often has much lower performance than the best hand-tuned codes. A promising code generation strategy, implemented by systems like ATLAS, FFTW and SPIRAL, uses empirical search to find the parameter values of the implementation, such as the tile size and instruction schedules, that deliver near-optimal performance for a particular machine. However this approach has only proven successful on scientific codes whose performance does not depend on the input data. In this paper we study machine learning techniques to extend empirical search to the generation of sorting routines, whose performance depends on the input characteristics and the architecture of the target machine.
We build on a previous study that selects a "pure" sorting algorithm at the outset of the computation as a function of the standard deviation. The approach discussed in this paper uses genetic algorithms and a classifier system to build hierarchically-organized hybrid sorting algorithms capable of adapting to the input data. Our results show that such algorithms generated using the approach presented in this paper are quite effective at taking into account the complex interactions between architectural and input data characteristics and that the resulting code performs significantly better than conventional sorting implementations and the code generated by our earlier study. In particular the routines generated using our approach perform better than all the commercial libraries that we tried including IBM ESSL, INTEL MKL and the C++STL. The best algorithm we have been able to generate is on the average 26% and 62% faster than the IBM ESSL in an IBM Power 3 and IBM Power 4, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, increasingly more microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been found and characterized within protein-coding genes and their untranslated regions (UTRs). These data provide useful information to study possible SSR functions. Here, we review SSR distributions within expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and genes including protein-coding, 3'-UTRs and 5'-UTRs, and introns; and discuss the consequences of SSR repeat-number changes in those regions of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Strong evidence shows that SSRs are nonrandomly distributed across protein-coding regions, UTRs, and introns. Substantial data indicates that SSR expansions and/or contractions in protein-coding regions can lead to a gain or loss of gene function via frameshift mutation or expanded toxic mRNA. SSR variations in 5'-UTRs could regulate gene expression by affecting transcription and translation. The SSR expansions in the 3'-UTRs cause transcription slippage and produce expanded mRNA, which can be accumulated as nuclear foci, and which can disrupt splicing and, possibly, disrupt other cellular function. Intronic SSRs can affect gene transcription, mRNA splicing, or export to cytoplasm. Triplet SSRs located in the UTRs or intron can also induce heterochromatin-mediated-like gene silencing. All these effects caused by SSR expansions or contractions within genes can eventually lead to phenotypic changes. SSRs within genes evolve through mutational processes similar to those for SSRs located in other genomic regions including replication slippage, point mutation, and recombination. These mutational processes generate DNA changes that should be connected by DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. Mutation that has escaped from the MMR system correction would become new alleles at the SSR loci, and then regulate and/or change gene products, and eventually lead to phenotype changes. Therefore, SSRs within genes should be subjected to stronger selective pressure than other genomic regions because of their functional importance. These SSRs may provide a molecular basis for fast adaptation to environmental changes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and SNP-detection method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36x coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1M BeadChip genotyped alleles from the same DNA sample showed that 98.6% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97% and 99.84% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of dbSNP alleles and were able to improve coverage of the dbSNP sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth.},

Although many human genes are found to have differential mRNA levels between populations, the extent of gene expression that could vary within and between populations largely remains elusive. To investigate the dynamic range of gene expression, we analyzed the expression variability of approximately 18, 000 human genes across individuals within HapMap populations. Although approximately 20% of human genes show differentiated mRNA levels between populations, our results show that expression variability of most human genes in one population is not significantly deviant from another population, except for a small fraction that do show substantially higher expression variability in a particular population. By associating expression variability with sequence polymorphism, intriguingly, we found SNPs in the untranslated regions (5' and 3'UTRs) of these variable genes show consistently elevated population heterozygosity. We performed differential expression analysis on a genome-wide scale, and found substantially reduced expression variability for a large number of genes, prohibiting them from being differentially expressed between populations. Functional analysis revealed that genes with the greatest within-population expression variability are significantly enriched for chemokine signaling in HIV-1 infection, and for HIV-interacting proteins that control viral entry, replication, and propagation. This observation combined with the finding that known human HIV host factors show substantially elevated expression variability, collectively suggest that gene expression variability might explain differential HIV susceptibility across individuals.},

Resampling is also an integral procedure in the registration of multi-modal datasets, such as CT, PET, and MRI, in the correction of motion artifacts in MRI, and in the alignment of temporal volume sequences in fMRI. It is well known that the quality of the resampling result depends heavily on the quality of the interpolation filter used. However, high-quality filters are rarely employed in practice due to their large spatial extents. In this paper, we explore a new resampling technique that operates in the frequency-domain where high-quality filtering is feasible. Further, unlike previous methods of this kind, our technique is not limited to integer-ratio scaling factors, but can resample image and volume datasets at any rate. This would usually require the application of slow Discrete Fourier Tran;forms (DFT) to return the data to the spatial domain. We studied two methods that successfully avoid these delays: the chirp-z transform and the FFTW package. We also outline techniques to avoid the ringing artifacts that may occur with frequency-domain filtering. Thus, our method can achieve high-quality interpolation at speeds that are usually associated with spatial filters of far lower quality.},

The proposed new padding scheme is shown to be able to provide a good estimate of the image intensities immediately outside the boundaries of the HRTEM images, reducing the estimated image intensity discontinuity across the boundaries and therefore providing a larger undistorted view of the exit wave.},

  Abstract                 = {Empirical search is an emerging strategy used in systems like ATLAS, FFTW and SPIRAL to find the parameter values of the implementation that deliver near-optimal performance for a particular machine. However, this approach has only proven successful for scientific kernels or serial symbolic sorting. Even commercial libraries like Intel MKL or IBM ESSL do not include parallel version of sorting routines. In this paper we study empirical search in the generation of parallel sorting routines for multi-core systems. Parallel sorting presents new challenges that the relative performance of the algorithms depends not only on the characteristics of the architectures and input data, but also on the data partitioning schemes and thread interactions. We have studied parallel sorting algorithms including quick sort, cache-conscious radix sort, multi-way merge sort, sample sort and quick-radix sort, and have built a sorting library using empirical search and artificial neural network. Our results show that this sorting library could generate the best parallel sorting algorithms for different input sets on both x86 and SPARC multi-core architectures, with a peak speedup of 2.2x and 3.9x, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has been considered one of the most important computing algorithms for decades. Its vast application domain makes it an important performance benchmark for new computer architectures. The most common Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm factorizes a large FFT into a combination of smaller ones. The choice of factors and the order in which they are applied are critical to the ultimate performance of the large FFT.
Traditional hand coded FFT libraries can immediately execute a given sized FFT applying constant heuristics to different kernel sizes, but are not always optimal. FFTW is a popular auto tuning FIT library which searches over the possible factorizations and empirically determines one with the best performance. This search method produces FFT kernels for a given size that are competitive with hand tuned libraries. Unfortunately, the search process for a large size takes hours on real hardware, and is completely infeasible to use when evaluating the FFT performance of new hardware which is still in the simulation phase. It is also less than ideal in environments where it is desirable to have a rapid response to a new sized FFT.
This paper introduces a novel performance model that allows the FFT performance of a given data size to be estimated to within 2% error without ever running the actual FFT In addition, by recognizing more sophisticated patterns within the computation, this model reduces the search tree size from a permutation of the number of factors to a combination. Because typical FFT sizes contain a large number of similar factors, this effectively reduces the search by an order of magnitude. When given a set of computational kernels, this model can completely characterize the performance of a chosen target architecture by just running some short performance tests on each sized kernel, a process which takes a few minutes or less. Once characterized, an optimal FFT plan for a given input size can be determined in milliseconds instead of hours.
In this paper, we first derive our mathematical model. We then validate its accuracy by using it to improve the performance of a state of the art, hand tuned FFT library by 30%. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness by replacing FFTWs own planning stage with our model, resulting in the same FFT performance using FFTW's own kernels in as little as one millionth the computation time.},

We compared the performance of these instruments by sequencing an isolate of Escherichia coli O104:H4, which caused an outbreak of food poisoning in Germany in 2011. The MiSeq had the highest throughput per run (1.6 Gb/run, 60 Mb/h) and lowest error rates. The 454 GS Junior generated the longest reads (up to 600 bases) and most contiguous assemblies but had the lowest throughput (70 Mb/run, 9 Mb/h). Run in 100-bp mode, the Ion Torrent PGM had the highest throughput (80-100 Mb/h). Unlike the MiSeq, the Ion Torrent PGM and 454 GS Junior both produced homopolymer-associated indel errors (1.5 and 0.38 errors per 100 bases, respectively).},

Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., BWA, Bowtie, ELAND) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation. This results in a higher useable sequence yield and improved accuracy compared to that of existing software.},

Glaser, G.H. Thomas, E.S. Siegfried, S.C.R. Elgin, and J.T. Lis, J. Mol. Biol. 211:751-761, 1990). This (CT)n element appears to contribute to formation of the wild-type chromatin structure of hsp26, an organized nucleosome array that leaves the HSEs in nucleosome-free, DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites (Q. Lu, L.L. Wallrath, B.D. Allan, R.L. Glaser, J.T. Lis, and S.C.R. Elgin, J. Mol. Biol. 225:985-998, 1992). Inspection of the sequences upstream of hsp26 has revealed an additional (CT)n element at -347 to -341, adjacent to the distal HSE. We have analyzed the contribution of this distal (CT)n element (-347 to -341), the proximal (CT)n element (-135 to -85), and the two HSEs both to the formation of the chromatin structure and to heat shock inducibility. hsp26 constructs containing site-directed mutations, deletions, substitutions, or rearrangements of these sequence elements have been fused in frame to the Escherichia coli lacZ gene and reintroduced into the D. melanogaster genome by P-element-mediated germ line transformation. Chromatin structure of the transgenes was analyzed (prior to gene activation) by DNase I or restriction enzyme treatment of isolated nuclei, and heat-inducible expression was monitored by measuring beta-galactosidase activity. The results indicate that mutations, deletions, or substitutions of either the distal or the proximal (CT)n element affect the chromatin structure and heat-inducible expression of the transgenes. These (CT)n repeats are associated with a nonhistone protein(s) in vivo and are bound by a purified Drosophila protein, the GAGA factor, in vitro. In contrast, the HSEs are required for heat-inducible expression but play only a minor role in establishing the chromatin structure of the transgenes. Previous analysis indicates that prior to heat shock, these HSEs appear to be free of protein. Our results suggest that GAGA factor, an abundant protein factor required for normal expression of many Drosophila genes, and heat shock factor, a specific transcription factor activated upon heat shock, play distinct roles in gene regulation: the GAGA factor establishes and/or maintains the DH sites prior to heat shock induction, while the activated heat shock factor recognizes and binds HSEs located within the DH sites to trigger transcription.},

We developed a PCR-based assay capable of quickly detecting the presence or absence of an expanded FMR1 allele with high sensitivity and specificity. This assay combines a triplet repeat primed PCR with high-throughput automated capillary electrophoresis. We evaluated assay performance using archived samples sent for Fragile X diagnostic testing representing a range of Fragile X CGG-repeat expansions. Two hundred five previously genotyped samples were tested with the new assay. Data were analyzed for the presence of a trinucleotide "ladder" extending beyond 55 repeats, which was set as a cut-off to identify expanded FMR1 alleles. We identified expanded FMR1 alleles in 132 samples (59 premutation, 71 full mutation, 2 mosaics) and normal FMR1 alleles in 73 samples. We found 100% concordance with previous results from PCR and Southern blot analyses. In addition, we show feasibility of using this assay with DNA extracted from dried-blood spots. Using a single PCR combined with high-throughput fragment analysis on the automated capillary electrophoresis instrument, we developed a rapid and reproducible PCR-based laboratory assay that meets many of the requirements for a first-tier test for population screening.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In recent years it has been demonstrated that structural variations, such as indels (insertions and deletions), are common throughout the genome, but the implications of structural variations are still not clearly understood. Long tandem repeats (e.g. microsatellites or simple repeats) are known to be hypermutable (indel-rich), but are rare in exons and only occasionally associated with diseases. Here we focus on short (imperfect) tandem repeats (STRs) which fall below the radar of conventional tandem repeat detection, and investigate whether STRs are targets for disease-related mutations in human exons. In particular, we test whether they share the hypermutability of the longer tandem repeats and whether disease-related genes have a higher STR content than non-disease-related genes. RESULTS: We show that validated human indels are extremely common in STR regions compared to non-STR regions. In contrast to longer tandem repeats, our definition of STRs found them to be present in exons of most known human genes (92%), 99% of all STR sequences in exons are shorter than 33 base pairs and 62% of all STR sequences are imperfect repeats. We also demonstrate that STRs are significantly overrepresented in disease-related genes in both human and mouse. These results are preserved when we limit the analysis to STRs outside known longer tandem repeats. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings we conclude that STRs represent hypermutable regions in the human genome that are linked to human disease. In addition, STRs constitute an obvious target when screening for rare mutations, because of the relatively low amount of STRs in exons (1,973,844 bp) and the limited length of STR regions.},

  Abstract                 = {Block based motion compensation techniques make frequent use of Early Termination Algorithms (ETA) to reduce the computational cost of block matching process. ETAs have been well studied in the context of Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) match measure and are effective in eliminating a large percentage of computations. As compared to SAD, the correlation coefficient (p) is a more robust measure but has high computational cost because no ETAs for p have been reported in literature. In this paper, we propose two types of ETAs for correlation coefficient: growth based and the bound based. In growth based ETA, p is computed as a monotonically decreasing measure. At a specific search location, when the partial value of p falls below the yet known maxima, remaining calculations are discarded. In bound based ETA, a new upper-bound on p is derived which is tighter than the currently used Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. The search locations where the proposed bound falls shorter than the yet known maxima are eliminated from the search space. Both types of algorithms are implemented in a cascade and tested on a commercial video dataset. In our experiments, up to 88% computations are found to be eliminated. In terms of execution time, our algorithm is up to 13.7 times faster than the FFTW based implementation and up to 4.6 times faster than the current best known spatial domain technique.},

By fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), somatic cell hybrids, and YAC screening, the X-linked members of this small family of sequences (CAIII) all map in Xp22, while the Y members map in Yq11. These loci contribute to the overall similarity of the two genomic regions. All of the CAIII loci contain an internal microsatellite of the (CA)n type. The microsatellites display extensive length polymorphism in two of the X-linked members as well as in the Y members. In addition, common sequence variants are found in the portions flanking the microsatellites in two of the X-linked members. Our results indicate that, during the evolution of this family, length variation on the Y chromosome was accumulated at a rate not slower than that on the X chromosome. Finally, these sequences represent a model system with which to analyze human populations for similar X- and Y-linked polymorphisms.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Type II syndactyly or synpolydactyly (SPD) is clinically very heterogeneous, and genetically three distinct SPD conditions are known and have been designated as SPD1, SPD2 and SPD3, respectively. SPD1 type is associated with expansion mutations in HOXD13, resulting in an addition of > or = 7 alanine residues to the polyalanine repeat. It has been suggested that expansions < or = 6 alanine residues go without medical attention, as no such expansion has ever been reported with the SPD1 phenotype. METHODS: We describe a large Pakistani and an Indian family with SPD. We perform detailed clinical and molecular analyses to identify the genetic basis of this malformation. RESULTS: We have identified four distinct clinical categories for the SPD1 phenotype observed in the affected subjects in both families. Next, we show that a milder foot phenotype, previously described as a separate entity, is in fact a part of the SPD1 phenotypic spectrum. Then, we demonstrate that the phenotype in both families segregates with an identical expansion mutation of 21 bp in HOXD13. Finally, we show that the HOXD13 polyalanine repeat is polymorphic, and the expansion of 2 alanine residues, evident in unaffected subjects of both families, is without clinical consequences. CONCLUSION: It is the first molecular evidence supporting the hypothesis that expansion of < or = 6 alanine residues in the HOXD13 polyalanine repeat is not associated with the SPD1 phenotype.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Clinical researchers need to share data to support scientific validation and information reuse and to comply with a host of regulations and directives from funders. Various organizations are constructing informatics resources in the form of centralized databases to ensure reuse of data derived from sponsored research. The widespread use of such open databases is contingent on the protection of patient privacy. METHODS: We review privacy-related problems associated with data sharing for clinical research from technical and policy perspectives. We investigate existing policies for secondary data sharing and privacy requirements in the context of data derived from research and clinical settings. In particular, we focus on policies specified by the US National Institutes of Health and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and touch on how these policies are related to current and future use of data stored in public database archives. We address aspects of data privacy and identifiability from a technical, although approachable, perspective and summarize how biomedical databanks can be exploited and seemingly anonymous records can be reidentified using various resources without hacking into secure computer systems. RESULTS: We highlight which clinical and translational data features, specified in emerging research models, are potentially vulnerable or exploitable. In the process, we recount a recent privacy-related concern associated with the publication of aggregate statistics from pooled genome-wide association studies that have had a significant impact on the data sharing policies of National Institutes of Health-sponsored databanks. CONCLUSION: Based on our analysis and observations we provide a list of recommendations that cover various technical, legal, and policy mechanisms that open clinical databases can adopt to strengthen data privacy protection as they move toward wider deployment and adoption.},

Phase-variable expression of NadA, an outer membrane protein and adhesin of the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, is mediated by changes in the number of TAAA repeats located upstream of the core promoter of nadA. Here we report that loss or gain of TAAA repeats affects the binding of the transcriptional regulatory protein IHF to the nadA promoter. Thus, phase-variable transcription of nadA potentially incorporates interplay between stochastic (mutational) and prescriptive (classical) mechanisms of gene regulation.},

Rare mutations have been found underlying two thousand mendelian diseases; more recently, it has become possible to assess systematically the contribution of common SNPs to complex disease. The known role of copy-number alterations in sporadic genomic disorders, combined with emerging information about inherited copy-number variation, indicate the importance of systematically assessing copy-number variants (CNVs), including common copy-number polymorphisms (CNPs), in disease. Here we discuss evidence that CNVs affect phenotypes, directions for basic knowledge to support clinical study of CNVs, the challenge of genotyping CNPs in clinical cohorts, the use of SNPs as markers for CNPs and statistical challenges in testing CNVs for association with disease. Critical needs are high-resolution maps of common CNPs and techniques that accurately determine the allelic state of affected individuals.},

  Abstract                 = {Ireland has one of the oldest systems of patrilineal hereditary surnames in the world. Using the paternal co-inheritance of Y-chromosome DNA and Irish surnames, we examined the extent to which modern surname groups share a common male-line ancestor and the general applicability of Y-chromosomes in uncovering surname origins and histories. DNA samples were collected from 1,125 men, bearing 43 different surnames, and each was genotyped for 17 Y-chromosome short tandem repeat (STR) loci. A highly significant proportion of the observed Y-chromosome diversity was found between surnames demonstrating their demarcation of real and recent patrilineal kinship. On average, a man has a 30-fold increased chance of sharing a 17 STR Y-chromosome haplotype with another man of the same surname but the extent of congruence between the surname and haplotype varies widely between surnames and we attributed this to differences in the number of early founders. Some surnames such as O'Sullivan and Ryan have a single major ancestor, whereas others like Murphy and Kelly have numerous founders probably explaining their high frequency today. Notwithstanding differences in their early origins, all surnames have been extensively affected by later male introgession. None examined showed more than about half of current bearers still descended from one original founder indicating dynamic and continuously evolving kinship groupings. Precisely because of this otherwise cryptic complexity there is a substantial role for the Y-chromosome and a molecular genealogical approach to complement and expand existing sources.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Despite growing concerns toward maintaining participants' privacy, individual investigators collecting tissue and other biological specimens for genomic analysis are encouraged to obtain informed consent for broad data sharing. Our purpose was to assess the effect on research enrollment and data sharing decisions of three different consent types (traditional, binary, or tiered) with varying levels of control and choices regarding data sharing. METHODS: A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 323 eligible adult participants being recruited into one of six genome studies at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, between January 2008 and August 2009. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental consent documents (traditional, n = 110; binary, n = 103; and tiered, n = 110). Debriefing in follow-up visits provided participants a detailed review of all consent types and the chance to change data sharing choices or decline genome study participation. RESULTS: Before debriefing, 83.9% of participants chose public data release. After debriefing, 53.1% chose public data release, 33.1% chose restricted (controlled access database) release, and 13.7% opted out of data sharing. Only one participant declined genome study participation due to data sharing concerns. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that most participants are willing to publicly release their genomic data; however, a significant portion prefers restricted release. These results suggest discordance between existing data sharing policies and participants' judgments and desires.},

We used a more stringent approach in computing robust allelotypes resulting in 94.4% of the 1095 informative repeats conforming to traditional inheritance.

Here, a simple three-node problem is used to demonstrate the convergence difficulties that can arise when solving the nonlinear, saturated ground water flow equation in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with and without nonlinear boundary conditions. For these cases, the characteristic types of convergence patterns are examined. Viewing these convergence patterns as orbits of an attractor in a dynamical system provides further insight. It is shown that the nonlinearity that arises from nonlinear head-dependent boundary conditions can cause more convergence difficulties than the nonlinearity that arises from flow in an unconfined aquifer. Furthermore, the effects of damping on both convergence and convergence rate are investigated. It is shown that no single strategy is effective for all problems and how understanding pitfalls and merits of several methods can be helpful in overcoming convergence difficulties. Results show that Picard iterations can be a simple and effective method for the solution of nonlinear, saturated ground water flow problems.},

Understanding the changing spectrum of ARF will be necessary to facilitate quality improvement efforts and to design successful interventional trials. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of 618 patients with ARF in intensive care units at five academic medical centers in the United States. Participants were required to sign (or have a proxy sign) informed consent for data collection. A comprehensive data collection instrument captured more than 800 variables, most on a daily basis, throughout the course of ARF. Patient characteristics, dialysis status, and major outcomes were determined and stratified by clinical site. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.5 years, 41% were women, and 20% were of minority race or ethnicity. There was extensive comorbidity; 30% had chronic kidney disease, 37% had coronary artery disease, 29% had diabetes mellitus, and 21% had chronic liver disease. Acute renal failure was accompanied by extrarenal organ system failure in most patients, even those who did not require dialysis. Three hundred and ninety-eight (64%) patients required dialysis. The in-hospital mortality rate was 37%, and the rate of mortality or nonrecovery of renal function was 50%. The median hospital length of stay was 25 days (26 days, excluding patients who died). CONCLUSION: There is a changing spectrum of ARF in the critically ill, characterized by a large burden of comorbid disease and extensive extrarenal complications, obligating the need for dialysis in the majority of patients. There is wide variation across institutions in patient characteristics and practice patterns. These differences highlight the need for additional multicenter observational and interventional studies in ARF.},

In MPRA, microarray-synthesized DNA regulatory elements and unique sequence tags are cloned into plasmids to generate a library of reporter constructs. These constructs are transfected into cells and tag expression is assayed by high-throughput sequencing. We apply MPRA to compare >27,000 variants of two inducible enhancers in human cells: a synthetic cAMP-regulated enhancer and the virus-inducible interferon-beta enhancer. We first show that the resulting data define accurate maps of functional transcription factor binding sites in both enhancers at single-nucleotide resolution. We then use the data to train quantitative sequence-activity models (QSAMs) of the two enhancers. We show that QSAMs from two cellular states can be combined to design enhancer variants that optimize potentially conflicting objectives, such as maximizing induced activity while minimizing basal activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Nearly 30 hereditary disorders in humans result from an increase in the number of copies of simple repeats in genomic DNA. These DNA repeats seem to be predisposed to such expansion because they have unusual structural features, which disrupt the cellular replication, repair and recombination machineries. The presence of expanded DNA repeats alters gene expression in human cells, leading to disease. Surprisingly, many of these debilitating diseases are caused by repeat expansions in the non-coding regions of their resident genes. It is becoming clear that the peculiar structures of repeat-containing transcripts are at the heart of the pathogenesis of these diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Asthma is caused by a combination of poorly understood genetic and environmental factors. We have systematically mapped the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the presence of childhood onset asthma by genome-wide association. We characterized more than 317,000 SNPs in DNA from 994 patients with childhood onset asthma and 1,243 non-asthmatics, using family and case-referent panels. Here we show multiple markers on chromosome 17q21 to be strongly and reproducibly associated with childhood onset asthma in family and case-referent panels with a combined P value of P < 10(-12). In independent replication studies the 17q21 locus showed strong association with diagnosis of childhood asthma in 2,320 subjects from a cohort of German children (P = 0.0003) and in 3,301 subjects from the British 1958 Birth Cohort (P = 0.0005). We systematically evaluated the relationships between markers of the 17q21 locus and transcript levels of genes in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from children in the asthma family panel used in our association study. The SNPs associated with childhood asthma were consistently and strongly associated (P < 10(-22)) in cis with transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results indicate that genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression are determinants of susceptibility to childhood asthma.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a numerical scheme for the analysis of steady-state nonlinear diffusion in random heterogeneous media. The key idea is to iteratively solve the nonlinear stochastic governing equations via an inexact Picard iteration scheme, wherein the nonlinear constitutive law is linearized using the current guess of the solution. The linearized stochastic governing equations are then spatially discretized and approximately solved using stochastic reduced basis projection schemes. The approximation to the solution process thus obtained is used as the guess for the next iteration. This iterative procedure is repeated until an appropriate convergence criterion is met. Detailed numerical studies are presented for diffusion in a square domain for varying degrees of nonlinearity. The numerical results are compared against benchmark Monte Carlo simulations, and it is shown that the proposed approach provides good approximations for the response statistics at modest computational effort.},

  Abstract                 = {the Frequency domain beam forming techniques specially using 2D-FFT process are used mostly in passive sonar. It provides good results mostly in applications like towed arrays that are towed behind submarines and ships. The linear hydrophone array is sampled in time The data is transformed from time domain into frequency domain by FFT process. Then another FIT is applied along the nth frequency bin in space. This provides good frequency contents of the towed arrays. The plot obtained from this 2DFFT process is called k-omega plot. In which frequency is on x axis and wave number k on y axis.
K-omega beam forming is widely used in passive sonar for detection, classification and localization purposes. The technique requires uniform linear array for beam forming. The linear hydrophone arrays are split into further sub arrays. These sub arrays are spaced spatially according to different cut frequencies. With the introduction of long passive arrays for naval and oil exploration purposes, the parallel K-omega processing problems becomes complex. Traditionally the implementation is done on cluster of IBM PowerPCs or more recently Intel Xeon clusters. The heavy computation load is often compromised with more optimized algorithms fit to specific architecture. This in practice requires major overhaul in the system if new feature is to be incorporated in the passive towed array sonar system. In this research paper the K-omega beam forming is implemented on IBM cell processor. The cell processor with its inherent parallelism in architecture provides an opportunity to execute processing of sub arrays concurrently. The K-omega beam forming is implemented on simulated 5 to 7 nested sub arrays and results are computed in simulator and tested against the Matlab outputs. The k omega beam forming used in this implementation depends on FFTW library along with EBM math, vector and matrix libraries. The implementation is benchmarked using EBM cell processor simulator.
Another aspect of cell processor found in this research paper is its very fine memory handling capability. This is vital for Matrix calculations and iterative tasks. From the implementation it is evident that this can be easily ported to commercially available system i.e. Sony playstation 3. The Sony playstation 3 with Linux fedora core 6 is ideal for such an application and it can be used for training of passive sonar operator.},

Repeat elements are heavily methylated in both germ and somatic cells; however, retrotransposons from several subfamilies evade methylation more effectively during male germ cell development, whereas other subfamilies show the opposite trend. Comparing methylomes of human and chimp sperm revealed a subset of differentially methylated promoters and strikingly divergent methylation in retrotransposon subfamilies, with an evolutionary impact that is apparent in the underlying genomic sequence. Thus, the features that determine DNA methylation patterns differ between male germ cells and somatic cells, and elements of these features have diverged between humans and chimpanzees.},

Here, we investigate the influence of rare and common genetic variants on gene expression patterns, using variants identified from sequencing data from the 1000 genomes project in an African and European population sample and gene expression data from lymphoblastoid cell lines. We detect comparable numbers of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) when compared to genotypes obtained from HapMap 3, but as many as 80% of the top expression quantitative trait variants (eQTVs) discovered from 1000 genomes data are novel. The properties of the newly discovered variants suggest that mapping common causal regulatory variants is challenging even with full resequencing data; however, we observe significant enrichment of regulatory effects in splice-site and nonsense variants. Using RNA sequencing data, we show that 46.2% of nonsynonymous variants are differentially expressed in at least one individual in our sample, creating widespread potential for interactions between functional protein-coding and regulatory variants. We also use allele-specific expression to identify putative rare causal regulatory variants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that outlier expression values can be due to rare variant effects, and we approximate the number of such effects harboured in an individual by effect size. Our results demonstrate that integration of genomic and RNA sequencing analyses allows for the joint assessment of genome sequence and genome function.},

Many studies have previously identified genetic variants for gene expression phenotypes using custom and commercially available microarrays. Second generation sequencing technologies are now providing unprecedented access to the fine structure of the transcriptome. We have sequenced the mRNA fraction of the transcriptome in 60 extended HapMap individuals of European descent and have combined these data with genetic variants from the HapMap3 project. We have quantified exon abundance based on read depth and have also developed methods to quantify whole transcript abundance. We have found that approximately 10 million reads of sequencing can provide access to the same dynamic range as arrays with better quantification of alternative and highly abundant transcripts. Correlation with SNPs (small nucleotide polymorphisms) leads to a larger discovery of eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) than with arrays. We also detect a substantial number of variants that influence the structure of mature transcripts indicating variants responsible for alternative splicing. Finally, measures of allele-specific expression allowed the identification of rare eQTLs and allelic differences in transcript structure. This analysis shows that high throughput sequencing technologies reveal new properties of genetic effects on the transcriptome and allow the exploration of genetic effects in cellular processes.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The transcription factor Fli1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recently, a GA(n) polymorphic microsatellite was characterized in the mouse Fli1 promoter that modulates promoter activity and is truncated in two lupus mouse models compared to non-autoimmune prone mice. In this work, we characterize a homologous GA(n) microsatellite in the human Fli1 promoter. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the microsatellite length on Fli1 promoter activity in vitro and to determine if the length of the GA(n) microsatellite is associated with SLE and/or specific disease characteristics. METHODS: Constructs with variable lengths of the GA(n) microsatellite in the Fli1 promoter were generated and analyzed in promoter/reporter (P/R) assays in a human T cell line. Using three SLE patient cohorts and matched controls, microsatellite length was measured and association with the presence of disease and the occurrence of specific disease manifestations was assessed. RESULTS: P/R assays demonstrated that the presence of a shorter microsatellite resulted in higher Fli1 promoter activity. A significant association was observed in the lupus cohort SLE in Gullah Health (SLEIGH) between the GA(26) base pair allele and absence of nephritis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a GA(n) microsatellite in the human Fli1 promoter is highly polymorphic. The length of the microsatellite is inversely correlated to Fli1 promoter activity in a human T cell line. Although no association between microsatellite length and lupus was observed, an association between a specific microsatellite length and patients without nephritis in the SLEIGH cohort was observed.},

The homozygous phenotype includes the transformation of metacarpal and metatarsal bones to short carpal- and tarsal-like bones. The mutations identify the polyalanine stretch outside of the DNA binding domain of HOXD13 as a region necessary for proper protein function.},

  Abstract                 = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are believed to have genetic and environmental origins, yet in only a modest fraction of individuals can specific causes be identified. To identify further genetic risk factors, here we assess the role of de novo mutations in ASD by sequencing the exomes of ASD cases and their parents (n = 175 trios). Fewer than half of the cases (46.3%) carry a missense or nonsense de novo variant, and the overall rate of mutation is only modestly higher than the expected rate. In contrast, the proteins encoded by genes that harboured de novo missense or nonsense mutations showed a higher degree of connectivity among themselves and to previous ASD genes as indexed by protein-protein interaction screens. The small increase in the rate of de novo events, when taken together with the protein interaction results, are consistent with an important but limited role for de novo point mutations in ASD, similar to that documented for de novo copy number variants. Genetic models incorporating these data indicate that most of the observed de novo events are unconnected to ASD; those that do confer risk are distributed across many genes and are incompletely penetrant (that is, not necessarily sufficient for disease). Our results support polygenic models in which spontaneous coding mutations in any of a large number of genes increases risk by 5- to 20-fold. Despite the challenge posed by such models, results from de novo events and a large parallel case-control study provide strong evidence in favour of CHD8 and KATNAL2 as genuine autism risk factors.},

We subjected the exomes of ten unrelated probands to massively parallel sequencing. After filtering against existing SNP databases, there was no compelling candidate gene containing previously unknown variants in all affected individuals. Less stringent filtering criteria allowed for the presence of modest genetic heterogeneity or missing data but also identified multiple candidate genes. However, genotypic and phenotypic stratification highlighted MLL2, which encodes a Trithorax-group histone methyltransferase: seven probands had newly identified nonsense or frameshift mutations in this gene. Follow-up Sanger sequencing detected MLL2 mutations in two of the three remaining individuals with Kabuki syndrome (cases) and in 26 of 43 additional cases. In families where parental DNA was available, the mutation was confirmed to be de novo (n = 12) or transmitted (n = 2) in concordance with phenotype. Our results strongly suggest that mutations in MLL2 are a major cause of Kabuki syndrome.},

Filtering against public SNP databases and eight HapMap exomes for genes with two previously unknown variants in each of the four individuals identified a single candidate gene, DHODH, which encodes a key enzyme in the pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis pathway. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of DHODH mutations in three additional families with Miller syndrome. Exome sequencing of a small number of unrelated affected individuals is a powerful, efficient strategy for identifying the genes underlying rare mendelian disorders and will likely transform the genetic analysis of monogenic traits.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is now followed by the challenge to determine how the reported susceptibility variants mediate complex traits and diseases. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been implicated in disease associations through overlaps between eQTLs and GWAS signals. However, the abundance of eQTLs and the strong correlation structure (LD) in the genome make it likely that some of these overlaps are coincidental and not driven by the same functional variants. In the present study, we propose an empirical methodology, which we call Regulatory Trait Concordance (RTC) that accounts for local LD structure and integrates eQTLs and GWAS results in order to reveal the subset of association signals that are due to cis eQTLs. We simulate genomic regions of various LD patterns with both a single or two causal variants and show that our score outperforms SNP correlation metrics, be they statistical (r(2)) or historical (D'). Following the observation of a significant abundance of regulatory signals among currently published GWAS loci, we apply our method with the goal to prioritize relevant genes for each of the respective complex traits. We detect several potential disease-causing regulatory effects, with a strong enrichment for immunity-related conditions, consistent with the nature of the cell line tested (LCLs). Furthermore, we present an extension of the method in trans, where interrogating the whole genome for downstream effects of the disease variant can be informative regarding its unknown primary biological effect. We conclude that integrating cellular phenotype associations with organismal complex traits will facilitate the biological interpretation of the genetic effects on these traits.},

Using a web site we developed to serve results of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines from HapMap samples (http://www.scandb.org), we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex traits (from http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/) are significantly more likely to be eQTLs than minor-allele-frequency-matched SNPs chosen from high-throughput GWAS platforms. These findings are robust across a range of thresholds for establishing eQTLs (p-values from 10(-4)-10(-8)), and a broad spectrum of human complex traits. Analyses of GWAS data from the Wellcome Trust studies confirm that annotating SNPs with a score reflecting the strength of the evidence that the SNP is an eQTL can improve the ability to discover true associations and clarify the nature of the mechanism driving the associations. Our results showing that trait-associated SNPs are more likely to be eQTLs and that application of this information can enhance discovery of trait-associated SNPs for complex phenotypes raise the possibility that we can utilize this information both to increase the heritability explained by identifiable genetic factors and to gain a better understanding of the biology underlying complex traits.},

  Abstract                 = {The challenge of understanding the widespread biological roles of animal microRNAs (miRNAs) has prompted the development of genetic and functional genomics technologies for miRNA loss-of-function studies. However, tools for exploring the functions of entire miRNA families are still limited. We developed a method that enables antagonism of miRNA function using seed-targeting 8-mer locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides, termed tiny LNAs. Transfection of tiny LNAs into cells resulted in simultaneous inhibition of miRNAs within families sharing the same seed with concomitant upregulation of direct targets. In addition, systemically delivered, unconjugated tiny LNAs showed uptake in many normal tissues and in breast tumors in mice, coinciding with long-term miRNA silencing. Transcriptional and proteomic profiling suggested that tiny LNAs have negligible off-target effects, not significantly altering the output from mRNAs with perfect tiny LNA complementary sites. Considered together, these data support the utility of tiny LNAs in elucidating the functions of miRNA families in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Tandem repeat variation in protein-coding regions will alter protein length and may introduce frameshifts. Tandem repeat variants are associated with variation in pathogenicity in bacteria and with human disease. We characterized tandem repeat polymorphism in human proteins, using the UniGene database, and tested whether these were associated with host defense roles. RESULTS: Protein-coding tandem repeat copy-number polymorphisms were detected in 249 tandem repeats found in 218 UniGene clusters; observed length differences ranged from 2 to 144 nucleotides, with unit copy lengths ranging from 2 to 57. This corresponded to 1.59% (218/13,749) of proteins investigated carrying detectable polymorphisms in the copy-number of protein-coding tandem repeats. We found no evidence that tandem repeat copy-number polymorphism was significantly elevated in defense-response proteins (p = 0.882). An association with the Gene Ontology term 'protein-binding' remained significant after covariate adjustment and correction for multiple testing. Combining this analysis with previous experimental evaluations of tandem repeat polymorphism, we estimate the approximate mean frequency of tandem repeat polymorphisms in human proteins to be 6%. Because 13.9% of the polymorphisms were not a multiple of three nucleotides, up to 1% of proteins may contain frameshifting tandem repeat polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: Around 1 in 20 human proteins are likely to contain tandem repeat copy-number polymorphisms within coding regions. Such polymorphisms are not more frequent among defense-response proteins; their prevalence among protein-binding proteins may reflect lower selective constraints on their structural modification. The impact of frameshifting and longer copy-number variants on protein function and disease merits further investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Tandem repeat (TR) variants in the human genome play key roles in a number of diseases. However, current models predicting variability are based on limited training sets. We conducted a systematic analysis of TRs of unit lengths 2-12 nucleotides in Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequences to define the extent of variation of 209,214 unique repeat loci throughout the genome. RESULTS: We applied a multivariate statistical model to predict TR variability. Predicted heterozygosity correlated with heterozygosity in the CEPH polymorphism database (correlation rho = 0.29, p < 0.0005) better than the correlation between the CEPH and WGS data (rho = 0.17), presumably because the model smoothes noise from small sample sizes. A multivariate logistic model of 8 parameters accounted for 36% of the variation in the WGS data. Validation studies of 70 experimentally investigated TRs revealed high concordance with the model's predictions (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Variability among 2-12-mer TRs in the genome can be modeled by a few parameters, which do not markedly differ according to unit length, consistent with a common mechanism for the generation of variability among such TRs. Analysis of the distributions of observed and predicted variants across the genome showed a general concordance, indicating that the repeat variation dataset does not exhibit strong regional ascertainment biases. This revealed a deficit of variant repeats in chromosomes 19 and Y - likely to reflect a reduction in 2-mer repeats in the former and a reduced level of recombination in the latter - and excesses in chromosomes 6, 13, 20 and 21.},

Balancing normative concerns of maximizing data utility and protecting human subjects, whose privacy is at risk due to the identifiability of DNA data, are central to policy decisions. Research on genome research participants making real-time data sharing decisions is limited; yet, these perspectives could provide critical information to ongoing deliberations. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of 3 consent types affording varying levels of control over data release decisions. After debriefing participants about the randomization process, we invited them to a follow-up interview to assess their attitudes toward genetic research, privacy and data sharing. RESULTS: Participants were more restrictive in their reported data sharing preferences than in their actual data sharing decisions. They saw both benefits and risks associated with sharing their genomic data, but risks were seen as less concrete or happening in the future, and were largely outweighed by purported benefits. CONCLUSION: Policymakers must respect that participants' assessment of the risks and benefits of data sharing and their privacy-utility determinations, which are associated with their final data release decisions, vary. In order to advance the ethical conduct of genome research, proposed policy changes should carefully consider these stakeholder perspectives.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence for the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has consistently pointed to a strong genetic component complicated by substantial locus heterogeneity. We sequenced the exomes of 20 individuals with sporadic ASD (cases) and their parents, reasoning that these families would be enriched for de novo mutations of major effect. We identified 21 de novo mutations, 11 of which were protein altering. Protein-altering mutations were significantly enriched for changes at highly conserved residues. We identified potentially causative de novo events in 4 out of 20 probands, particularly among more severely affected individuals, in FOXP1, GRIN2B, SCN1A and LAMC3. In the FOXP1 mutation carrier, we also observed a rare inherited CNTNAP2 missense variant, and we provide functional support for a multi-hit model for disease risk. Our results show that trio-based exome sequencing is a powerful approach for identifying new candidate genes for ASDs and suggest that de novo mutations may contribute substantially to the genetic etiology of ASDs.},

In three unrelated individuals with myotonic dystrophy that have large expansions of the triplet repeat, the allele with the triplet repeat expansion exhibited both overall DNase I resistance and inaccessibility of nucleases to the adjacent hypersensitive site.

Each haplotype was linked to a unique sequence tag embedded within a transcriptional cassette. We introduced each enhancer library into mouse liver and measured the relative activities of individual haplotypes en masse by sequencing the transcribed tags. Linear regression analysis yielded highly reproducible estimates of the effect of every possible single-nucleotide change on enhancer activity. The functional consequence of most mutations was modest, with approximately 22% affecting activity by >1.2-fold and approximately 3% by >2-fold. Several, but not all, positions with higher effects showed evidence for purifying selection, or co-localized with known liver-associated transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating the value of empirical high-resolution functional analysis.},

Straight-forward 2D convolutions show up to a 130:1 speedup on the GPU over the CPU, with an average speedup in our tests of 59:1.

  Abstract                 = {Rapid advances in DNA sequencing and genotyping technologies are beginning to reveal the scope and pattern of human genomic variation. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been intensively studied, the extent and form of variation at other types of molecular variants remain poorly understood. Polymorphism at the most variable loci in the human genome, microsatellites, has rarely been examined on a genomic scale without the ascertainment biases that attend typical genotyping studies. We conducted a genomic survey of variation at microsatellites with at least three perfect repeats by comparing two complete genome sequences, the Human Genome Reference sequence and the sequence of J. Craig Venter. The genomic proportion of polymorphic loci was 2.7%, much higher than the rate of SNP variation, with marked heterogeneity among classes of loci. The proportion of variable loci increased substantially with repeat number. Repeat lengths differed in levels of variation, with longer repeat lengths generally showing higher polymorphism at the same repeat number. Microsatellite variation was weakly correlated with regional SNP number, indicating modest effects of shared genealogical history. Reductions in variation were detected at microsatellites located in introns, in untranslated regions, in coding exons, and just upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting the presence of selective constraints. Our results provide new insights into microsatellite mutational processes and yield a preview of patterns of variation that will be obtained in genomic surveys of larger numbers of individuals.},

  Abstract                 = {Patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) reveal the action of evolutionary processes and provide crucial information for association mapping of disease genes. Although recent studies have described the landscape of LD among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from across the human genome, associations involving other classes of molecular variation remain poorly understood. In addition to recombination and population history, mutation rate and process are expected to shape LD. To test this idea, we measured associations between short-tandem-repeat polymorphisms (STRPs), which can mutate rapidly and recurrently, and SNPs in 721 regions across the human genome. We directly compared STRP-SNP LD with SNP-SNP LD from the same genomic regions in the human HapMap populations. The intensity of STRP-SNP LD, measured by the average of D', was reduced, consistent with the action of recurrent mutation. Nevertheless, a higher fraction of STRP-SNP pairs than SNP-SNP pairs showed significant LD, on both short (up to 50 kb) and long (cM) scales. These results reveal the substantial effects of mutational processes on LD at STRPs and provide important measures of the potential of STRPs for association mapping of disease genes.},

DNA repeat expansion mutations are dynamic and ongoing within tissues and across generations. The patterns of inherited and tissue-specific instability are determined by both gene-specific cis-elements and trans-acting DNA metabolic proteins. Repeat instability probably involves the formation of unusual DNA structures during DNA replication, repair and recombination. Experimental advances towards explaining the mechanisms of repeat instability have broadened our understanding of this mutational process. They have revealed surprising ways in which metabolic pathways can drive or protect from repeat instability.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Microsatellite loci are frequently used in genomic studies of DNA sequence repeats and in population studies of genetic variability. To investigate the effect of sequence properties of microsatellites on their level of variability we have analyzed genotypes at 627 microsatellite loci in 1,048 worldwide individuals from the HGDP-CEPH cell line panel together with the DNA sequences of these microsatellites in the human RefSeq database. RESULTS: Calibrating PCR fragment lengths in individual genotypes by using the RefSeq sequence enabled us to infer repeat number in the HGDP-CEPH dataset and to calculate the mean number of repeats (as opposed to the mean PCR fragment length), under the assumption that differences in PCR fragment length reflect differences in the numbers of repeats in the embedded repeat sequences. We find the mean and maximum numbers of repeats across individuals to be positively correlated with heterozygosity. The size and composition of the repeat unit of a microsatellite are also important factors in predicting heterozygosity, with tetra-nucleotide repeat units high in G/C content leading to higher heterozygosity. Finally, we find that microsatellites containing more separate sets of repeated motifs generally have higher heterozygosity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sequence properties of microsatellites have a significant impact in determining the features of human microsatellite variability.},

Recent studies, including PICARD and BEST, have examined the epidemiology of ICU-related AKI in the USA and worldwide, respectively, and found that AKI remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The incidence of AKI has increased, most likely due to a trend toward older, more severely and chronically ill patients admitted to the hospital. Sepsis and multi-organ system failure continue to be strongly associated with AKI, as well as pre-morbid chronic kidney disease. The proportion of patients with AKI requiring dialysis is high. The mortality of ICU-related AKI, although still very elevated, may be decreasing. Understanding these changes, in the context of standardized definitions, will be essential for the design of successful interventional studies.},

However, most existing methods consider either reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate but not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across the branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the more general problem of detecting departures from the neutral rate of substitution in either direction, possibly in a clade-specific manner. We consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing this problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based on exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) test. All four tests have been implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably similar in statistical power. With 36 mammalian species, they all appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low false-positive rates in detecting strong selection at individual nucleotides, moderate selection in 3-bp elements, and weaker or clade-specific selection in longer elements. By applying phyloP to mammalian multiple alignments from the ENCODE project, we shed light on patterns of conservation/acceleration in known and predicted functional elements, approximate fractions of sites subject to constraint, and differences in clade-specific selection in the primate and glires clades. We also describe new "Conservation" tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser that display both phyloP and phastCons scores for genome-wide alignments of 44 vertebrate species.},

Using this system, we generated eight tet-regulated shRNA transgenic lines targeting Firefly and Renilla luciferases, Oct4 and tumor suppressors p53, p16(INK4a), p19(ARF) and APC and demonstrate potent gene silencing and GFP-tracked knockdown in a broad range of tissues in vivo. Further, using an shRNA targeting APC, we illustrate how this approach can identify predicted phenotypes and also unknown functions for a well-studied gene. In addition, through regulated gene silencing we validate APC/Wnt and p19(ARF) as potential therapeutic targets in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and lung adenocarcinoma, respectively.

We argue that STR variants are more likely than single-nucleotide variants to have epistatic interactions, reiterate the need for targeted assays to genotype STRs accurately, and call for more appropriate statistical methods in detecting STR-phenotype associations. Lastly, we suggest that somatic STR variation within individuals may serve as a read-out of disease susceptibility, and is thus potentially a valuable covariate for future association studies.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BEDTools was written in C++.

  Abstract                 = {Equilibrium models of isolation by distance predict an increase in genetic differentiation with geographic distance. Here we find a linear relationship between genetic and geographic distance in a worldwide sample of human populations, with major deviations from the fitted line explicable by admixture or extreme isolation. A close relationship is shown to exist between the correlation of geographic distance and genetic differentiation (as measured by F(ST)) and the geographic pattern of heterozygosity across populations. Considering a worldwide set of geographic locations as possible sources of the human expansion, we find that heterozygosities in the globally distributed populations of the data set are best explained by an expansion originating in Africa and that no geographic origin outside of Africa accounts as well for the observed patterns of genetic diversity. Although the relationship between F(ST) and geographic distance has been interpreted in the past as the result of an equilibrium model of drift and dispersal, simulation shows that the geographic pattern of heterozygosities in this data set is consistent with a model of a serial founder effect starting at a single origin. Given this serial-founder scenario, the relationship between genetic and geographic distance allows us to derive bounds for the effects of drift and natural selection on human genetic variation.},

In Drosophila, Piwi proteins and their bound small RNAs (piRNAs) provide a potent defense against TE activity. TE targeting piRNAs are processed from TE-dense heterochromatic loci termed piRNA clusters. Although piRNA biogenesis from cluster precursors is beginning to be understood, little is known about piRNA cluster transcriptional regulation. Here, we show that deposition of histone 3 lysine 9 by the methyltransferase dSETDB1 (egg) is required for piRNA cluster transcription. In the absence of dSETDB1, cluster precursor transcription collapses in germline and somatic gonadal cells and TEs are activated, resulting in germline loss and a block in germline stem cell differentiation. We propose that heterochromatin protects the germline by activating the piRNA pathway.},

This population was not involved in the putative gene flow from Neanderthals into Eurasians; however, the data suggest that it contributed 4-6% of its genetic material to the genomes of present-day Melanesians. We designate this hominin population 'Denisovans' and suggest that it may have been widespread in Asia during the Late Pleistocene epoch. A tooth found in Denisova Cave carries a mitochondrial genome highly similar to that of the finger bone. This tooth shares no derived morphological features with Neanderthals or modern humans, further indicating that Denisovans have an evolutionary history distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans.},

We have previously shown that a founder haplotype, covering the MOBKL2b, IFNK, and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases linked to this region. Here we show that there is a large hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 on the affected haplotype. This repeat expansion segregates perfectly with disease in the Finnish population, underlying 46.0% of familial ALS and 21.1% of sporadic ALS in that population. Taken together with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87% of familial ALS in Finland is now explained by a simple monogenic cause. The repeat expansion is also present in one-third of familial ALS cases of outbred European descent, making it the most common genetic cause of these fatal neurodegenerative diseases identified to date.},

We also directly estimated a human intergeneration mutation rate of approximately 1.1 x 10(-8) per position per haploid genome. Both offspring in this family have two recessive disorders: Miller syndrome, for which the gene was concurrently identified, and primary ciliary dyskinesia, for which causative genes have been previously identified. Family-based genome analysis enabled us to narrow the candidate genes for both of these Mendelian disorders to only four. Our results demonstrate the value of complete genome sequencing in families.},

  Abstract                 = {Changes in gene expression and regulation--due in particular to the evolution of cis-regulatory DNA sequences--may underlie many evolutionary changes in phenotypes, yet little is known about the distribution of such variation in populations. We present in this study the first survey of experimentally validated functional cis-regulatory polymorphism. These data are derived from more than 140 polymorphisms involved in the regulation of 107 genes in Homo sapiens, the eukaryote species with the most available data. We find that functional cis-regulatory variation is widespread in the human genome and that the consequent variation in gene expression is twofold or greater for 63% of the genes surveyed. Transcription factor-DNA interactions are highly polymorphic, and regulatory interactions have been gained and lost within human populations. On average, humans are heterozygous at more functional cis-regulatory sites (>16,000) than at amino acid positions (<13,000), in part because of an overrepresentation among the former in multiallelic tandem repeat variation, especially (AC)(n) dinucleotide microsatellites. The role of microsatellites in gene expression variation may provide a larger store of heritable phenotypic variation, and a more rapid mutational input of such variation, than has been realized. Finally, we outline the distinctive consequences of cis-regulatory variation for the genotype-phenotype relationship, including ubiquitous epistasis and genotype-by-environment interactions, as well as underappreciated modes of pleiotropy and overdominance. Ordinary small-scale mutations contribute to pervasive variation in transcription rates and consequently to patterns of human phenotypic variation.},

The results are compared against Intel's implementation of the split-radix FFT for the SIMD architecture [2] and the FFTW [3]. Overall, the SIMD-FFT was found to be faster than the other two implementations for complex 1D input data (ranging from 95.9% up to 372%), and for complex 2D input data (ranging from 68.8% up to 343%) as well.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied human population structure using genotypes at 377 autosomal microsatellite loci in 1056 individuals from 52 populations. Within-population differences among individuals account for 93 to 95% of genetic variation; differences among major groups constitute only 3 to 5%. Nevertheless, without using prior information about the origins of individuals, we identified six main genetic clusters, five of which correspond to major geographic regions, and subclusters that often correspond to individual populations. General agreement of genetic and predefined populations suggests that self-reported ancestry can facilitate assessments of epidemiological risks but does not obviate the need to use genetic information in genetic association studies.},

We have determined 99.3% of the euchromatic sequence of the X chromosome. Our analysis illustrates the autosomal origin of the mammalian sex chromosomes, the stepwise process that led to the progressive loss of recombination between X and Y, and the extent of subsequent degradation of the Y chromosome. LINE1 repeat elements cover one-third of the X chromosome, with a distribution that is consistent with their proposed role as way stations in the process of X-chromosome inactivation. We found 1,098 genes in the sequence, of which 99 encode proteins expressed in testis and in various tumour types. A disproportionately high number of mendelian diseases are documented for the X chromosome. Of this number, 168 have been explained by mutations in 113 X-linked genes, which in many cases were characterized with the aid of the DNA sequence.},

Here we describe a DNA sequencing technology in which scalable, low-cost semiconductor manufacturing techniques are used to make an integrated circuit able to directly perform non-optical DNA sequencing of genomes. Sequence data are obtained by directly sensing the ions produced by template-directed DNA polymerase synthesis using all-natural nucleotides on this massively parallel semiconductor-sensing device or ion chip. The ion chip contains ion-sensitive, field-effect transistor-based sensors in perfect register with 1.2 million wells, which provide confinement and allow parallel, simultaneous detection of independent sequencing reactions. Use of the most widely used technology for constructing integrated circuits, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, allows for low-cost, large-scale production and scaling of the device to higher densities and larger array sizes. We show the performance of the system by sequencing three bacterial genomes, its robustness and scalability by producing ion chips with up to 10 times as many sensors and sequencing a human genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Many sequences in eukaryotic genomes have the potential to adopt a left-handed Z-DNA conformation. We used a previously described assay based on the binding of a mAb to Z-DNA to inquire whether Z-DNA is formed in the rat nucleolin (Ncl) gene in metabolically active, permeabilized nuclei. Using real-time PCR to measure Z-DNA formation, the potential Z-DNA sequence element Z1 [(CA)(10)(CG)(8)] in the promoter region was found to be enriched 571- to 4,040-fold in different cell lines, whereas Z2 [AC(GC)(5)CCGT(CG)(2)] in the first intron was enriched 12- to 34-fold. Ncl promoter activity was 1.5- to 16-fold stronger than that of the simian virus 40 promoter and enhancer. This activity was further increased 36-54% when Z1 was deleted. The inhibitory effect of Z1 on Ncl promoter activity was independent of location and orientation. The Ncl Z1 element is identical to the genetic marker D9Arb5. Five allelic variants of Z1 were identified by sequence analysis of genomic DNA from various rats. The two most common alleles differed significantly (up to 27%) in their capacity to inhibit Ncl promoter activity. This finding suggests that differences in Z-DNA formation by polymorphic dinucleotide repeats may be one of the factors contributing to genetic variation.},

The Swift XRT also obtained early observations starting at 69 s after the burst onset. The X-ray light curve shows the same features as the optical light curve.

Nucleotide diversity varies greatly across the genome, in a manner broadly consistent with a standard population genetic model of human history.

The computer code is written in C and uses a singular value decomposition (SVD) routine from the LAPACK library and the fast Fourier transform for spatial filtering from the FFTW library. Various offset estimation and topographic correction algorithms are implemented, including simultaneous inversion for deformation rates and residual topographic error. This approach is particularly useful when applied to ALOS PALSAR interferograms that are coherent even at large perpendicular baselines and acquired with orbital parameters correlated with the time of acquisition. This methodology is applied to produce time series of ground deformation at Tauhara and Wairakei geothermal fields (Taupo Volcanic Zone, North Island, New Zealand) from 12 ALOS PALSAR images acquired between July 2007 and December 2009. We also present here a high-resolution deformation map of the ground subsidence caused by the extraction of geothermal groundwater for power generation, with maximum rates of subsidence of about 7 cm/y.

  Abstract                 = {Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating, late-onset, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that manifests with personality changes, movement disorders, and cognitive decline. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene that translates to a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein (HTT). The formation of HTT fragments has been implicated as an essential step in the molecular pathogenesis of HD and several proteases that cleave HTT have been identified. However, the importance of smaller N-terminal fragments has been highlighted by their presence in HD postmortem brains and by the fact that nuclear inclusions are only detected by antibodies to the N terminus of HTT. Despite an intense research effort, the precise length of these fragments and the mechanism by which they are generated remains unknown. Here we show that CAG repeat length-dependent aberrant splicing of exon 1 HTT results in a short polyadenylated mRNA that is translated into an exon 1 HTT protein. Given that mutant exon 1 HTT proteins have consistently been shown to be highly pathogenic in HD mouse models, the aberrant splicing of HTT mRNA provides a mechanistic basis for the molecular pathogenesis of HD. RNA-targeted therapeutic strategies designed to lower the levels of HTT are under development. Many of these approaches would not prevent the production of exon 1 HTT and should be reviewed in light of our findings.},

  Abstract                 = {Tandem repeats are genomic elements that are prone to changes in repeat number and are thus often polymorphic. These sequences are found at a high density at the start of human genes, in the gene's promoter. Increasing empirical evidence suggests that length variation in these tandem repeats can affect gene regulation. One class of tandem repeats, known as microsatellites, rapidly alter in repeat number. Some of the genetic variation induced by microsatellites is known to result in phenotypic variation. Recently, our group developed a novel method for measuring the evolutionary conservation of microsatellites, and with it we discovered that human microsatellites near transcription start sites are often highly conserved. In this study, we examined the properties of microsatellites found in promoters. We found a high density of microsatellites at the start of genes. We showed that microsatellites are statistically associated with promoters using a wavelet analysis, which allowed us to test for associations on multiple scales and to control for other promoter related elements. Because promoter microsatellites tend to be G/C rich, we hypothesized that G/C rich regulatory elements may drive the association between microsatellites and promoters. Our results indicate that CpG islands, G-quadruplexes (G4) and untranslated regulatory regions have highly significant associations with microsatellites, but controlling for these elements in the analysis does not remove the association between microsatellites and promoters. Due to their intrinsic lability and their overlap with predicted functional elements, these results suggest that many promoter microsatellites have the potential to affect human phenotypes by generating mutations in regulatory elements, which may ultimately result in disease. We discuss the potential functions of human promoter microsatellites in this context.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA profiling can be used to capture the expression patterns of many genes that are associated with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Employing published putative cis eQTLs, we developed a Bayesian approach to predict SNP genotypes that is based only on RNA expression data. We show that predicted genotypes can accurately and uniquely identify individuals in large populations. When inferring genotypes from an expression data set using eQTLs of the same tissue type (but from an independent cohort), we were able to resolve 99% of the identities of individuals in the cohort at P(adjusted) </= 1 x 10(-5). When eQTLs derived from one tissue were used to predict genotypes using expression data from a different tissue, the identities of 90% of the study subjects could be resolved at P(adjusted) </= 1 x 10(-5). We discuss the implications of deriving genotypic information from RNA data deposited in the public domain.},

The first multiplex is the Y-STR 20plex previously described by Butler et al. [Forensic Sci. Int. 129 (2002) 10]. The second multiplex is a novel Y-STR 11plex and includes DYS385 a/b, DYS447, DYS448 and the new markers DYS450, DYS456, DYS458, and DYS464 a/b/c/d. These two multiplexes were tested on 647 males from three United States population sample sets: 260 African Americans, 244 Caucasians, and 143 Hispanics. Haplotype comparisons between common loci included in the 20plex and 11plex assays as well as commercially available kits found excellent agreement across a sampling of the population samples. The multi-copy loci DYS464, DYS385, and YCAII were the most polymorphic followed by the following single copy Y-STRs: DYS458, DYS390, DYS447, DYS389II, DYS448, and DYS456.

  Abstract                 = {A polymorphism in the promoter of human NRAMP1 encodes a Z-DNA forming dinucleotide repeat with four alleles: (1) t(gt)5ac(gt)5ac(gt)11g; (2) t(gt)5ac(gt)5 ac(gt)10g; (3) t(gt)5ac(gt) ac(gt)9g; and (4) t(gt)5ac(gt)9g. Alleles 1 and 4 are rare (gene frequencies approximately 0.001); alleles 2 and 3 occur at gene frequencies approximately 0.20-0.25 and approximately 0.75-0.80, respectively. Here, luciferase reporter gene constructs are used to show that the four alleles differ in their ability to drive gene expression. In the absence of exogenous stimuli, alleles 1, 2, and 4 are poor promoters; allele 3 drives high expression, indicating that the repeat itself has endogenous enhancer activity. All four alleles show a similar percentage enhancement of reporter gene expression in the presence of interferon-gamma, consistent with the multiple interferon-gamma response elements both 5' and 3' of the Z-DNA forming repeat. However, while the addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has no effect on alleles 1 and 4, it causes significant reduction in expression driven by allele 2 and enhances expression driven by allele 3, suggesting that the juxtaposition of LPS related response elements (NFkappaB, AP-1, NF-IL6) may be differentially affected by the two commonly occurring alleles. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic hyperactivation of macrophages associated with allele 3 is functionally linked to autoimmune disease susceptibility, while the poor level of NRAMP1 expression promoted by allele 2 contributes to infectious disease susceptibility. Conversely, allele 3 protects against infectious disease and allele 2 against autoimmune disease. Hence, alleles that are detrimental in relation to autoimmune disease susceptibility may be maintained in the population because they improve survival to reproductive age following infectious disease challenge.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Repetitive DNA sequences, besides having a variety of regulatory functions, are one of the principal causes of genomic instability. Understanding their origin and evolution is of fundamental importance for genome studies. The identification of repeats and their units helps in deducing the intra-genomic dynamics as an important feature of comparative genomics. A major difficulty in identification of repeats arises from the fact that the repeat units can be either exact or imperfect, in tandem or dispersed, and of unspecified length. RESULTS: The Spectral Repeat Finder program circumvents these problems by using a discrete Fourier transformation to identify significant periodicities present in a sequence. The specific regions of the sequence that contribute to a given periodicity are located through a sliding window analysis, and an exact search method is then used to find the repetitive units. Efficient and complete detection of repeats is provided together with interactive and detailed visualization of the spectral analysis of input sequence. We demonstrate the utility of our method with various examples that contain previously unannotated repeats. A Web server has been developed for convenient access to the automated program.

Luciferase assays using MMP-9 promoter containing 18, 14 or 0 d(CA) repeats showed transcriptional activities which were 50, 50 or 5%, respectively, of the level achieved with promoter containing 21 d(CA) repeats. Sequence analysis of the promoter of 223 Japanese subjects revealed that most had two alleles with 20, 21 or 22 d(CA) repeats, whereas six had one or two alleles with 14, 18 or 19 d(CA) repeats.

The polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1; PABP2) gene has been identified as the mutated gene. The mutation consists of a short meiotically stable trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of PABPN1 gene. We have investigated Dutch OPMD patients from four unrelated families and identified a new mutation in two of the four families. Instead of a repeat expansion we found a duplication in the first exon of the PABPN1 gene (c.27_28ins12, p.11_12insAAAA). The identification of this new mutation supports the theory of unequal crossing-over as molecular mechanism causing the mutation in the PABPN1 gene responsible for OPMD, and not the slippage model.},

  Abstract                 = {Tight binding can be extended to magnetic systems by including an exchange interaction on an atomic site that favours net spin polarisation. We have used a published model, extended to include long-ranged Coulomb interactions, to study defects in iron. We have found that achieving self-consistency using conventional techniques was either unstable or very slow. By formulating the problem of achieving charge and spin self-consistency as a search for stationary points of a Harris-Foulkes functional, extended to include spin, we have derived a much more efficient scheme based on a Newton-Raphson procedure. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by looking at vacancies and self-interstitials in iron. Self-consistency can indeed be achieved in a more efficient and stable manner, but care needs to be taken to manage this. The algorithm is implemented in the code PLATO.

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes
Nature of problem: Achieving charge and spin self-consistency in magnetic tight binding can be very difficult. Our existing schemes failed altogether, or were very slow.
Solution method: A new scheme for achieving self-consistency in orthogonal tight binding has been introduced that explicitly evaluates the first and second derivatives of the energy with respect to input charge and spin, and then uses these to search for stationary values of the energy.
Reasons for new version: Bug fixes and new functionality.
Summary of revisions: New charge and spin mixing scheme for orthogonal tight binding. Numerous small bug fixes.
Restrictions: The new mixing scheme scales poorly with system size. In particular the memory usage scales as number of atoms to the power 4. It is restricted to systems with about 200 atoms or less.
Running time: Test cases will run in a few minutes, large calculations may run for several days. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Tandem repeats (TR) are stretches of DNA that are highly variable in length and mutate rapidly, and thus an important source of genetic variation. This variation is highly informative for population and conservation genetics, and has also been associated with several pathological conditions and with gene expression regulation. However, genome-wide surveys of TR variation have been scarce due to the technical difficulties derived from short-read technology. Here, we explored the genome-wide diversity of TRs in a panel of 83 human and nonhuman great ape genomes, and their impact on gene expression evolution. We found that populations and species diversity patterns can be efficiently captured with short TRs (repeat unit length 1-5 base pairs) with potential applications in conservation genetics. We also examined the potential evolutionary role of TRs in gene expression differences between humans and primates by using 30,275 larger TRs (repeat unit length 2-50 base pairs). About one third of the 13,035 one-to-one orthologous genes contained TRs within 5 kilobase pairs of their transcription start site, and had higher expression divergence than genes without such TRs. The same observation held for genes with repeats in their 3′ untranslated region, in introns, and in exons. Using our polymorphism data for the shortest TRs, we found that genes with polymorphic repeats in their promoters showed higher expression divergence in humans and chimpanzees compared to genes with fixed or no TRs in the promoters. Our findings highlight the potential contribution of TRs to recent human evolution through gene regulation.},

To provide a framework for the role of miRNAs in B-cell development and malignancy, we deep-sequenced miRNAs from B1 cells and 10 developmental stages that can be identified within the mouse B2 B-cell lineage. The expression profiles of the 232 known miRNAs that are expressed during B-cell development display stage-specific induction patterns, yet hierarchical clustering analysis showed relationships that are in full agreement with the model of the B2 B-cell developmental pathway. Analysis of exemplary miRNA expression profiles (miR-150, miR-146a, miR-155, miR-181) confirmed that our data are in agreement with previous results. The high resolution of the expression data allowed for the identification of the sequential expression of oncomir-1/miR-17-92 and its paralogs miR-106a-363 and miR-106b-25 in subsequent developmental stages in the BM. Further, we have identified and validated 45 novel miRNAs and 6 novel miRNA candidates expressed in developing B cells.},

Given the wealth of genomic data and the increasing number of genotype-phenotype association studies in model organisms, one can ask whether and how this information can be used for non-model organisms. Here we describe two strategies to search for likely functional polymorphisms in candidate genes in a bird species that has been intensively studied by behavioural and population ecologists, the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus. In the first approach we searched for repeating elements in coding regions of the genome using information about repeats in Gallus gallus genes. The rationale is that tandem-repeat elements have a high potential to be polymorphic and functional. The second strategy aimed to replicate reported genotype-phenotype association studies by extrapolating results from model organisms to our study species. Both strategies showed high success rates with respect to finding homologous gene regions and potentially informative genetic variants in the genes AANAT, ADCYAP1, CKIepsilon, CLOCK, CREB1, NPAS2 and PERIOD2.},

To determine the overall contribution of CNVs to complex phenotypes, we have performed association analyses of expression levels of 14,925 transcripts with SNPs and CNVs in individuals who are part of the International HapMap project. SNPs and CNVs captured 83.6% and 17.7% of the total detected genetic variation in gene expression, respectively, but the signals from the two types of variation had little overlap. Interrogation of the genome for both types of variants may be an effective way to elucidate the causes of complex phenotypes and disease in humans.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic basis of gene expression variation has long been studied with the aim to understand the landscape of regulatory variants, but also more recently to assist in the interpretation and elucidation of disease signals. To date, many studies have looked in specific tissues and population-based samples, but there has been limited assessment of the degree of inter-population variability in regulatory variation. We analyzed genome-wide gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a total of 726 individuals from 8 global populations from the HapMap3 project and correlated gene expression levels with HapMap3 SNPs located in cis to the genes. We describe the influence of ancestry on gene expression levels within and between these diverse human populations and uncover a non-negligible impact on global patterns of gene expression. We further dissect the specific functional pathways differentiated between populations. We also identify 5,691 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) after controlling for both non-genetic factors and population admixture and observe that half of the cis-eQTLs are replicated in one or more of the populations. We highlight patterns of eQTL-sharing between populations, which are partially determined by population genetic relatedness, and discover significant sharing of eQTL effects between Asians, European-admixed, and African subpopulations. Specifically, we observe that both the effect size and the direction of effect for eQTLs are highly conserved across populations. We observe an increasing proximity of eQTLs toward the transcription start site as sharing of eQTLs among populations increases, highlighting that variants close to TSS have stronger effects and therefore are more likely to be detected across a wider panel of populations. Together these results offer a unique picture and resource of the degree of differentiation among human populations in functional regulatory variation and provide an estimate for the transferability of complex trait variants across populations.},

We find that gene expression is heritable and that differentiation between populations is in agreement with earlier small-scale studies. A detailed association analysis of over 2.2 million common SNPs per population (5% frequency in HapMap) with gene expression identified at least 1,348 genes with association signals in cis and at least 180 in trans. Replication in at least one independent population was achieved for 37% of cis signals and 15% of trans signals, respectively. Our results strongly support an abundance of cis-regulatory variation in the human genome. Detection of trans effects is limited but suggests that regulatory variation may be the key primary effect contributing to phenotypic variation in humans. We also explore several methodologies that improve the current state of analysis of gene expression variation.},

Population-level forces driving triplet repeat contraction and expansion in multicellular organisms are, however, not well understood. We have identified a triplet repeat-associated genetic defect in an Arabidopsis thaliana variety collected from the wild. The Bur-0 strain carries a dramatically expanded TTC/GAA repeat in the intron of the ISOPROPYL MALATE ISOMERASE LARGE SUB UNIT1 (IIL1; At4g13430) gene. The repeat expansion causes an environment-dependent reduction in IIL1 activity and severely impairs growth of this strain, whereas contraction of the expanded repeat can reverse the detrimental phenotype. The Bur-0 IIL1 defect thus presents a genetically tractable model for triplet repeat expansions and their variability in natural populations.},

This points to a single surname founder for extant Sykes males, even though written sources had predicted multiple origins. The distribution of other Sykes Y-chromosome haplotypes were not significantly different from those in controls and may be accounted for by the historical accumulation of nonpaternity during the past 700 years, in which case the average rate estimate is 1.3%/generation.

  Abstract                 = {The class of complex modified Kortewegde Vries (CMKdV) equations has many applications. One form of the CMKdV equation hag been used to create models for the nonlinear evolution of plasma waves [5], for the propagation of transverse waves in a molecular chain [3]. Another form of the CMKdV equation. has been used for the traveling-wave and for a double homoclinic orbit [4].
In this paper we introduce sequential and parallel split-step Fourier methods for numerical simulations of the above equation. The parallel methods are implemented on the Origin 2000 multiprocessor computer. Our numerical experiments have shown that these methods give considerable speedup.},

  Abstract                 = {In the male germline in mammals, chromatoid bodies, a specialized assembly of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP), are structurally evident during meiosis and haploidgenesis, but their developmental origin and regulation remain elusive. The tudor domain containing proteins constitute a conserved class of chromatoid body components. We show that tudor domain containing 7 (Tdrd7), the deficiency of which causes male sterility and age-related cataract (as well as glaucoma), is essential for haploid spermatid development and defines, in concert with Tdrd6, key biogenesis processes of chromatoid bodies. Single and double knockouts of Tdrd7 and Tdrd6 demonstrated that these spermiogenic tudor genes orchestrate developmental programs for ordered remodeling of chromatoid bodies, including the initial establishment, subsequent RNP fusion with ubiquitous processing bodies/GW bodies and later structural maintenance. Tdrd7 suppresses LINE1 retrotransposons independently of piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis wherein Tdrd1 and Tdrd9 operate, indicating that distinct Tdrd pathways act against retrotransposons in the male germline. Tdrd6, in contrast, does not affect retrotransposons but functions at a later stage of spermiogenesis when chromatoid bodies exhibit aggresome-like properties. Our results delineate that chromatoid bodies assemble as an integrated compartment incorporating both germline and ubiquitous features as spermatogenesis proceeds and that the conserved tudor family genes act as master regulators of this unique RNP remodeling, which is genetically linked to the male germline integrity in mammals.},

We identified over 500,000 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), the majority of which were rare (86% with a minor allele frequency less than 0.5%), previously unknown (82%), and population-specific (82%). On average, 2.3% of the 13,595 SNVs each person carried were predicted to affect protein function of ~313 genes per genome, and ~95.7% of SNVs predicted to be functionally important were rare. This excess of rare functional variants is due to the combined effects of explosive, recent accelerated population growth and weak purifying selection. Furthermore, we show that large sample sizes will be required to associate rare variants with complex traits.},

Between 53 and 70 chromosomes were fully screened for sequence variation at each locus by using the method of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. The sum of the lengths of the three genes is 64,120 bp. We have used these data to study the ancestral genealogy of human Y chromosomes. In particular, we focused on estimating the expected time to the most recent common ancestor and the expected ages of certain mutations with interesting geographic distributions. Although the geographic structure of the inferred haplotype tree is reminiscent of that obtained for other loci (the root is in Africa, and most of the oldest non-African lineages are Asian), the expected time to the most recent common ancestor is remarkably short, on the order of 50,000 years. Thus, although previous studies have noted that Y chromosome variation shows extreme geographic structure, we estimate that the spread of Y chromosomes out of Africa is much more recent than previously was thought. We also show that our data indicate substantial population growth in the effective number of human Y chromosomes.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites. RESULTS: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development. AVAILABILITY: TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and approximately 1 h of hands-on time.},

From a computational perspective, repeats create ambiguities in alignment and assembly, which, in turn, can produce biases and errors when interpreting results. Simply ignoring repeats is not an option, as this creates problems of its own and may mean that important biological phenomena are missed.

While many studies have identified non-coding annotations overlapping disease variants, these annotations colocalize, complicating fine-mapping efforts. We demonstrate that conventional enrichment tests are inflated and cannot distinguish causal effects from colocalizing annotations. We developed a sensitive and specific statistical approach that is able to identify independent effects from colocalizing annotations. We first confirm that gene regulatory variants map to DNase-I hypersensitive sites (DHS) near transcription start sites. We then show that (1) 15-35% of causal variants within disease loci map to DHS independent of other annotations; (2) breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis loci harbor potentially causal variants near the summits of histone marks rather than full peak bodies; and (3) variants associated with height are highly enriched for embryonic stem cell DHS sites. We highlight specific loci where we can most effectively prioritize causal variation.Received September 17, 2014.Accepted September 17, 2014.© 2014, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressThis pre-print is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International), CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, as described at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/},

  Abstract                 = {A cytological analsis of the recently discovered tetraploid species Xenopus epitropicalis was carried out, using, in addition to the classical orcein method, silver staining and alkaline Giemsa banding techniques. The chromosome number of X. epitropicalis was found to be 40. The chromosomes can be grouped in to sets of four similar chromosomes (quartets), resembling the karyotype of X. tropicalis (2n = 20). However, C-band patterns revealed heterogeneity within the quartets, dividing each of them into two pairs of homologous chromosomes ("duets"). Moreover, there are differences in the position and distribution of constitutive heterochromatin between the karyotypes of X. epitropicalis and X. tropicalis. The secondary constrictions stained by silver and representing the nucleolar organizer regions (NOR's) appear in both species on chromosome pair 5. During meiosis, usually only bivalents appear in X. epitropicalis. The question of whether this species is of autopolyploid or allopolyploid origin cannot be answered with certainty; however, it seems to have a common ancestor with X. tropicalis.},

In humans, expansion of intragenic triplet repeats is associated with various diseases, including Huntington chorea and fragile X syndrome. The persistence of intragenic repeats in genomes suggests that there is a compensating benefit. Here we show that in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most genes containing intragenic repeats encode cell-wall proteins. The repeats trigger frequent recombination events in the gene or between the gene and a pseudogene, causing expansion and contraction in the gene size. This size variation creates quantitative alterations in phenotypes (e.g., adhesion, flocculation or biofilm formation). We propose that variation in intragenic repeat number provides the functional diversity of cell surface antigens that, in fungi and other pathogens, allows rapid adaptation to the environment and elusion of the host immune system.},

A search for tandem repeats in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome revealed that the nucleosome-free region directly upstream of genes (the promoter region) is enriched in repeats. As many as 25% of all gene promoters contain tandem repeat sequences. Genes driven by these repeat-containing promoters show significantly higher rates of transcriptional divergence. Variations in repeat length result in changes in expression and local nucleosome positioning. Tandem repeats are variable elements in promoters that may facilitate evolutionary tuning of gene expression by affecting local chromatin structure.},

One such system is FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) for the discrete Fourier transform. In this paper, we review FFTW's inner workings with an emphasis on its code generator, and report on our empirical evaluation of the system on two different hardware and compiler platforms. We then describe a number of our own extensions to the FFTW code generator that compute efficient discrete cosine transforms and show promising speed-ups over a vendor-tuned library We also comment on current opportunities to develop tuning systems in the spirit of FFTW for other widely-used kernels.},

We argue that the distribution of the time t to the MRCA is the most natural measure of relatedness for such nonrecombining regions. Both an infinite-alleles (no recurring mutants) and stepwise mutation model are examined, and these agree well when n is moderate to large and k/n is close to one. As expected, the infinite alleles model underestimates t relative to the stepwise model. Using a modest number (20) of microsatellite markers is sufficient to obtain reasonably precise estimates of t for individuals separated by 200 or less generations. Hence, the multilocus haplotypes of two individuals can be used not only to date very deep ancestry but also rather recent ancestry as well. Finally, our results have forensic implications in that a complete match at all markers between a suspect and a sample excludes only a modest subset of the population unless a very large number of markers (>500 microsatellites) are used.},

  Abstract                 = {Eukaryotic cells express several classes of small RNAs that regulate gene expression and ensure genome maintenance. Endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) mainly control gene and transposon expression in the germline, while microRNAs (miRNAs) generally function in post-transcriptional gene silencing in both somatic and germline cells. To provide an evolutionary and developmental perspective on small RNA pathways in nematodes, we identified and characterized known and novel small RNA classes through gametogenesis and embryo development in the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum and compared them with known small RNAs of Caenorhabditis elegans. piRNAs, Piwi-clade Argonautes, and other proteins associated with the piRNA pathway have been lost in Ascaris. miRNAs are synthesized immediately after fertilization in utero, before pronuclear fusion, and before the first cleavage of the zygote. This is the earliest expression of small RNAs ever described at a developmental stage long thought to be transcriptionally quiescent. A comparison of the two classes of Ascaris endo-siRNAs, 22G-RNAs and 26G-RNAs, to those in C. elegans, suggests great diversification and plasticity in the use of small RNA pathways during spermatogenesis in different nematodes. Our data reveal conserved characteristics of nematode small RNAs as well as features unique to Ascaris that illustrate significant flexibility in the use of small RNAs pathways, some of which are likely an adaptation to Ascaris' life cycle and parasitism.

This picture has changed with advances in the systematic annotation of functional noncoding elements. Evolutionary conservation, functional genomics, chromatin state, sequence motifs and molecular quantitative trait loci all provide complementary information about the function of noncoding sequences. These functional maps can help with prioritizing variants on risk haplotypes, filtering mutations encountered in the clinic and performing systems-level analyses to reveal processes underlying disease associations. Advances in predictive modeling can enable data-set integration to reveal pathways shared across loci and alleles, and richer regulatory models can guide the search for epistatic interactions. Lastly, new massively parallel reporter experiments can systematically validate regulatory predictions. Ultimately, advances in regulatory and systems genomics can help unleash the value of whole-genome sequencing for personalized genomic risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment.},

Expression of the nitric oxide synthases is altered in the retinal vasculature in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. We analyzed the allele distribution of a polymorphic pentanucleotide repeat within the 5' upstream promoter region of the NOS2A gene in samples of diabetic patients. In diabetic patients from Northern Ireland, the 14-repeat allele of the NOS2A marker was significantly associated with the absence of diabetic retinopathy. Carriers of this repeat had 0.21-fold the relative risk of developing diabetic retinopathy than noncarriers of this allele. They also had significantly fewer renal and cardiovascular complications. The ability of differing numbers of (CCTTT)(n) pentanucleotide repeats to induce transcription of the NOS2A gene was analyzed using a luciferase reporter gene assay in transfected colonic carcinoma cells. Interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) induction was most effective in constructs carrying the 14-repeat allele. When cells were incubated in 25 mM glucose to mimic the diabetic state, IL-1beta induction was inhibited in all cases, but to a significantly lesser extent with the 14-repeat allele. These unique properties of the 14-repeat allele may confer selective advantages in diabetic individuals, which may delay or prevent microvascular complications of diabetes.},

Forty-seven initial mutation events were detected in the STRPs using DNA from transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, but less than half (39%) could be verified using DNA from untransformed cells. None of the cases where three alleles were observed in a single individual could be verified using DNA from untransformed cells. The average mutation rate for the chromosome 19 STRPs after correction for events which would not be detectable as Mendelian errors was 1.2 x 10(-3) per locus per gamete per generation. This rate may have been inflated by somatic as opposed to germline events. Observed mutation rates for individual STRPs ranged from 0 to 8 x 10(-3). The average mutation rate for tetranucleotide STRPs was nearly four times higher than the average rate for dinucleotide STRPs. For determination of the mode of mutation, events involving STRPs on other chromosomes were also examined. Of the events which were verified using DNA from untransformed lymphocytes or which were likely among those for which DNA from untransformed cells was not available: none were located at the sites of meiotic recombination, 91% involved the gain or loss of a single repeat unit, and 15 occurred in the male germline compared to 4 in the female germline (p = 0.01).},

Characterization of a genetic locus, lic-1, responsible for expression of two LPS epitopes displaying phase variation, showed it to comprise four genes. The first gene mediates phase variation. At its 5' end, within the open reading frame, are a variable number of tandem repeats of the tetramer CAAT. By shifting upstream initiation codons in or out of frame, these 4 bp units create a translational switch. The phenotype of organisms corresponds to the number of 4 bp units. Phase variation between three levels of expression ( +, +, and -) of lic-1-derived epitopes is caused by differences in the three phases of translation of the 5' terminus of this gene. Phase variation also allows for selection of organisms displaying certain LPS epitopes in vivo.},

This variability is associated with a number of genetic disorders in humans including triplet expansion diseases such as Fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease. The mechanism responsible for the variability/instability of these tandem arrays remains contentious. We show here that formation of secondary structures, in particular intrastrand tetraplexes, is an intrinsic property of some of the more unstable arrays. Tetraplexes block DNA polymerase progression and may promote instability of tandem arrays by increasing the likelihood of reiterative strand slippage. In the course of doing this work we have shown that some of these tetraplexes involve unusual base interactions. These interactions not only generate tetraplexes with novel properties but also lead us to conclude that the number of sequences that can form stable tetraplexes might be much larger than previously thought.},

  Abstract                 = {The association of genetic variation with disease and drug response, and improvements in nucleic acid technologies, have given great optimism for the impact of 'genomic medicine'. However, the formidable size of the diploid human genome, approximately 6 gigabases, has prevented the routine application of sequencing methods to deciphering complete individual human genomes. To realize the full potential of genomics for human health, this limitation must be overcome. Here we report the DNA sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual, James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4-fold redundancy in two months using massively parallel sequencing in picolitre-size reaction vessels. This sequence was completed in two months at approximately one-hundredth of the cost of traditional capillary electrophoresis methods. Comparison of the sequence to the reference genome led to the identification of 3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 10,654 cause amino-acid substitution within the coding sequence. In addition, we accurately identified small-scale (2-40,000 base pair (bp)) insertion and deletion polymorphism as well as copy number variation resulting in the large-scale gain and loss of chromosomal segments ranging from 26,000 to 1.5 million base pairs. Overall, these results agree well with recent results of sequencing of a single individual by traditional methods. However, in addition to being faster and significantly less expensive, this sequencing technology avoids the arbitrary loss of genomic sequences inherent in random shotgun sequencing by bacterial cloning because it amplifies DNA in a cell-free system. As a result, we further demonstrate the acquisition of novel human sequence, including novel genes not previously identified by traditional genomic sequencing. This is the first genome sequenced by next-generation technologies. Therefore it is a pilot for the future challenges of 'personalized genome sequencing'.},

  Abstract                 = {Microsatellites are widely used in genetic analyses, many of which require reliable estimates of microsatellite mutation rates, yet the factors determining mutation rates are uncertain. The most straightforward and conclusive method by which to study mutation is direct observation of allele transmissions in parent-child pairs, and studies of this type suggest a positive, possibly exponential, relationship between mutation rate and allele size, together with a bias toward length increase. Except for microsatellites on the Y chromosome, however, previous analyses have not made full use of available data and may have introduced bias: mutations have been identified only where child genotypes could not be generated by transmission from parents' genotypes, so that the probability that a mutation is detected depends on the distribution of allele lengths and varies with allele length. We introduce a likelihood-based approach that has two key advantages over existing methods. First, we can make formal comparisons between competing models of microsatellite evolution; second, we obtain asymptotically unbiased and efficient parameter estimates. Application to data composed of 118,866 parent-offspring transmissions of AC microsatellites supports the hypothesis that mutation rate increases exponentially with microsatellite length, with a suggestion that contractions become more likely than expansions as length increases. This would lead to a stationary distribution for allele length maintained by mutational balance. There is no evidence that contractions and expansions differ in their step size distributions.},

Bordetella pertussis, the etiological agent of whooping cough, produces two serologically distinct fimbriae. We show that, like a number of other B. pertussis virulence genes, transcription of the fimbrial subunit genes (fim) is positively controlled by trans-acting polypeptides encoded by the bvg locus. In addition to this coordinate control, transcription of the fim genes is regulated at an individual level by phase variation. This process is characterized by a switching between a high and low level of expression of a particular fim gene. We have identified a conserved DNA region, located close to the start of the fim genes, which is likely to be involved in both positive regulation by the bvg locus, and phase variation. This promoter region contains a stretch of approximately 15 C residues and it appears that phase transitions occur by small insertions or deletions in this C-rich region. We propose that these mutations affect transcription of the fim genes by varying the distance between the binding site for an activator and the -10 box. The fim promoter shows homology with the pertussis toxin promoter, which is also positively regulated by the bvg locus.},

  Abstract                 = {We assessed gene expression profiles in 2,752 twins, using a classic twin design to quantify expression heritability and quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in peripheral blood. The most highly heritable genes ( approximately 777) were grouped into distinct expression clusters, enriched in gene-poor regions, associated with specific gene function or ontology classes, and strongly associated with disease designation. The design enabled a comparison of twin-based heritability to estimates based on dizygotic identity-by-descent sharing and distant genetic relatedness. Consideration of sampling variation suggests that previous heritability estimates have been upwardly biased. Genotyping of 2,494 twins enabled powerful identification of eQTLs, which we further examined in a replication set of 1,895 unrelated subjects. A large number of non-redundant local eQTLs (6,756) met replication criteria, whereas a relatively small number of distant eQTLs (165) met quality control and replication standards. Our results provide a new resource toward understanding the genetic control of transcription.},

After a discussion of the translation and optimization techniques implemented in the compiler, we use SPL formulations of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to evaluate the compiler.

In the past, estimates of mutation rates have generally been inferred from phenotypic observations or comparisons of homologous sequences among closely related species. Here, we apply new sequencing technology to measure directly one mutation rate, that of base substitutions on the human Y chromosome. The Y chromosomes of two individuals separated by 13 generations were flow sorted and sequenced by Illumina (Solexa) paired-end sequencing to an average depth of 11x or 20x, respectively. Candidate mutations were further examined by capillary sequencing in cell-line and blood DNA from the donors and additional family members. Twelve mutations were confirmed in approximately 10.15 Mb; eight of these had occurred in vitro and four in vivo. The latter could be placed in different positions on the pedigree and led to a mutation-rate measurement of 3.0 x 10(-8) mutations/nucleotide/generation (95% CI: 8.9 x 10(-9)-7.0 x 10(-8)), consistent with estimates of 2.3 x 10(-8)-6.3 x 10(-8) mutations/nucleotide/generation for the same Y-chromosomal region from published human-chimpanzee comparisons depending on the generation and split times assumed.},

  Abstract                 = {Cigarette smoke, containing reactive oxygen species, is the most important risk factor for chronic pulmonary emphysema (CPE). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) plays a protective role as an antioxidant in the lung. A (GT)n dinucleotide repeat in the 5'-flanking region of human HO-1 gene shows length polymorphism and could modulate the level of gene transcription. To investigate the correlation between the length of the (GT)n repeat and susceptibility to the development of CPE, we screened the frequencies of alleles with varying numbers of (GT)n repeats in the HO-1 gene in 101 smokers with CPE and in 100 smokers without CPE. Polymorphisms of the (GT)n repeat were grouped into three classes: class S alleles (<25 repeats), class M alleles (25-29 repeats), and class L alleles (>/=30 repeats). The proportion of allele frequencies in class L, as well as the proportion of genotypic frequencies in the group with class L alleles (L/L, L/M, and L/S), was significantly higher in the smokers with CPE than in smokers without CPE. Moreover, we analyzed the promoter activities of the HO-1 gene carrying different (GT)n repeats (n=16, 20, 29, and 38), by transient-transfection assay in cultured cell lines. H2O2 exposure up-regulated the transcriptional activity of the HO-1 promoter/luciferase fusion genes with (GT)16 or (GT)20 but did not do so with (GT)29 or (GT)38. These findings suggest that the large size of a (GT)n repeat in the HO-1 gene promoter may reduce HO-1 inducibility by reactive oxygen species in cigarette smoke, thereby resulting in the development of CPE.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene expression is determined by genomic elements called enhancers, which contain short motifs bound by different transcription factors (TFs). However, how enhancer sequences and TF motifs relate to enhancer activity is unknown, and general sequence requirements for enhancers or comprehensive sets of important enhancer sequence elements have remained elusive. Here, we computationally dissect thousands of functional enhancer sequences from three different Drosophila cell lines. We find that the enhancers display distinct cis-regulatory sequence signatures, which are predictive of the enhancers' cell type-specific or broad activities. These signatures contain transcription factor motifs and a novel class of enhancer sequence elements, dinucleotide repeat motifs (DRMs). DRMs are highly enriched in enhancers, particularly in enhancers that are broadly active across different cell types. We experimentally validate the importance of the identified TF motifs and DRMs for enhancer function and show that they can be sufficient to create an active enhancer de novo from a nonfunctional sequence. The function of DRMs as a novel class of general enhancer features that are also enriched in human regulatory regions might explain their implication in several diseases and provides important insights into gene regulation.},

We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45% of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

The unusual structural basis for Vlp variation was revealed in a cluster of related but divergent vlp genes, vlpA, vlpB and vlpC, which occur as single chromosomal copies. These encode conserved N-terminal domains for membrane insertion and lipoprotein processing, but divergent external domains undergoing size variation by loss or gain of repetitive intragenic coding sequences while retaining a motif with distinctive charge distribution. Genetic analysis of phenotypically switched isogenic lineages representing ON or OFF expression states of Vlp products ruled out chromosomal rearrangement or frameshift mutations as mechanisms for Vlp phase variation. However, highly conserved vlp promoter regions contain a tract of contiguous A residues immediately upstream of the -10 box which is subject to frequent mutations altering its length in exact correspondence with the ON and OFF phase states of specific genes. This suggests a mechanism of transcriptional control regulating high frequency phase variation and random combinatorial expression of Vlps. The multiple levels of diversity embodied in the vlp gene cluster represents a novel adaptive capability particularly suited for this class of wall-less microbe.},

Both data sets have continuous coverage at high signal-to-noise levels from the prompt phase onward, and thus the early observations are readily compared to the Swift XRT and BAT high-energy detections. In both cases, the optical afterglow is established, declining steadily during the prompt emission. For GRB 051111, there is evidence of an excess optical component during the prompt emission. The component is consistent with the flux spectrally extrapolated from the gamma-rays, using the gamma-ray spectral index. A compilation of spectral information from previous prompt detections shows that such a component is unusual. The existence of two prompt optical components-one connected to the high-energy emission, the other to separate afterglow flux, as indicated in GRB 051111-is not compatible with a simple "external-external'' shock model for the GRB and its afterglow.},

  Abstract                 = {The androgen receptor (AR) gene is localized on chromosome X, and shorter CAG repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene were recently suggested to increase hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk among men. To examine whether the relationship between the AR-CAG repeats and HCC was also evident among women, we conducted a case-control study in Taiwan. The number of AR-CAG repeats was determined for 238 women with HCC and 354 unrelated control subjects (comprising 188 first-degree and 166 nonbiological relatives) selected from female relatives of patients with HCC. Women harboring 2 AR alleles with more than 23 CAG repeats had an increased risk of HCC (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% CI, 1.06-3.14), compared with women with only short alleles or a single long allele. The association between harboring 2 AR alleles containing longer CAG repeats and HCC was more striking among HBV carriers (age-adjusted OR for more than 22 repeats, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.14-4.34) and particularly prominent among HBV carriers under age 53 years (age-adjusted OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.13-8.82). When CAG repeats were analyzed as a continuous variable, the increase in HCC risk associated with each incremental repeat in the shorter of 2 alleles in a given genotype was statistically significant among women with a first-degree relative with HCC (age-adjusted OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.37). No such relationship was detected among women without the family history. In conclusion, our observations suggest that the AR-CAG alleles may contribute to HCC predisposition among women through a mechanism different from that for men.},

  Abstract                 = {In Drosophila, Piwi proteins associate with Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and protect the germline genome by silencing mobile genetic elements. This defense system acts in germline and gonadal somatic tissue to preserve germline development. Genetic control for these silencing pathways varies greatly between tissues of the gonad. Here, we identified Vreteno (Vret), a novel gonad-specific protein essential for germline development. Vret is required for piRNA-based transposon regulation in both germline and somatic gonadal tissues. We show that Vret, which contains Tudor domains, associates physically with Piwi and Aubergine (Aub), stabilizing these proteins via a gonad-specific mechanism that is absent in other fly tissues. In the absence of vret, Piwi-bound piRNAs are lost without changes in piRNA precursor transcript production, supporting a role for Vret in primary piRNA biogenesis. In the germline, piRNAs can engage in an Aub- and Argonaute 3 (AGO3)-dependent amplification in the absence of Vret, suggesting that Vret function can distinguish between primary piRNAs loaded into Piwi-Aub complexes and piRNAs engaged in the amplification cycle. We propose that Vret plays an essential role in transposon regulation at an early stage of primary piRNA processing.},

Thus being able to interpret the functional consequence of a variant is essential for identifying causal variants in the analysis of GWAS studies. We present GERV (Generative Evaluation of Regulatory Variants), a novel computational method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription factor binding. GERV learns a k-mer based generative model of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data, and scores variants by computing the change of predicted ChIP-seq reads between the reference and alternate allele. The k-mers learned by GERV capture more sequence determinants of transcription factor binding than a motif-based approach alone, including both a transcription factor{\textquoteright}s canonical motif as well as associated co-factor motifs. We show that GERV outperforms existing methods in predicting SNPs associated with allele-specific binding. GERV correctly predicts a validated causal variant among linked SNPs, and prioritizes the variants previously reported to modulate the binding of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell lines. Thus, GERV provides a powerful approach for functionally annotating and prioritizing causal variants for experimental follow-up analysis.},

It was found in 16 populations throughout a large region of Asia, stretching from the Pacific to the Caspian Sea, and was present at high frequency: approximately 8% of the men in this region carry it, and it thus makes up approximately 0.5% of the world total. The pattern of variation within the lineage suggested that it originated in Mongolia approximately 1,000 years ago. Such a rapid spread cannot have occurred by chance; it must have been a result of selection. The lineage is carried by likely male-line descendants of Genghis Khan, and we therefore propose that it has spread by a novel form of social selection resulting from their behavior.},

Gilbert, S. Guha, P. Indyk, S. Muthukrishnan, M. Strauss, Near-Optimal Sparse Fourier Representations via Sampling, STOC, 2002]. Its time cost poly(log(N)) should be compared with the superlinear Omega(N logN) time requirement of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A straightforward implementation of the RAlSFA, as presented in the theoretical paper [A.C. Gilbert, S. Guha, P. Indyk, S. Muthukrishnan, M. Strauss, Near-Optimal Sparse Fourier Representations via Sampling, STOC, 2002], turns out to be very slow in practice. Our main result is a greatly improved and practical RAlSFA. We introduce several new ideas and techniques that speed up the algorithm. Both rigorous and heuristic arguments for parameter choices are presented. Our RAlSFA constructs, with probability at least 1 - delta, a near-optimal B-term representation R in time poly(B) log(N) log(1/delta)/is an element of(2) log(M) such that vertical bar vertical bar S - R vertical bar vertical bar(2)(2) <= (1 + is an element of) vertical bar vertical bar S - R(opt)vertical bar vertical bar(2)(2). Furthermore, this RAlSFA implementation already beats the FFTW for not unreasonably large N. We extend the algorithm to higher dimensional cases both theoretically and numerically. The crossover point lies at N similar or equal to 70, 000 in one dimension, and at N similar or equal to 900 for data on a N x N grid in two dimensions for small B signals where there is noise.

We therefore developed a toolkit that combines Tet-regulated miR30-shRNA technology, robust transactivator expression and two fluorescent reporters to track and isolate cells with potent target knockdown. We demonstrated that this system improves the study of essential genes and was sufficiently robust to eradicate aggressive cancer in mice by suppressing a single gene. Further, we applied this system for in vivo negative-selection screening with pooled shRNAs and propose a streamlined, inexpensive workflow that will facilitate the use of RNA interference (RNAi) for the identification and evaluation of essential therapeutic targets.},
